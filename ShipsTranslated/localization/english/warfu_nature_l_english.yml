But unlike in the past, you will fall asleep after a day of exhaustion. Recently, sleep seems to be deliberately avoiding you. Normally. You are sitting in your study, sluggishly moving the chess pieces on the chessboard, taking a sip of red wine from time to time, hoping to regain sleepiness by relying on alcohol. Suddenly, you hear someone walking behind you, and you turn around on the chair. Seeing it. [Defender.GetTitledFirstName] took a walk with you a few days ago. "Good evening, [attacker.GetTitledFirstName]. I haven’t introduced myself yet. I’m the god of death, I’m here to harvest your soul." You see [defender.GetTitledFirstName] holds a shiny sickle in his hand..."

Stretching out your trembling hand, you took the bishop across the entire chessboard, and put down the chess pieces with a soft muffled sound. "General," you whispered softly. Tao, looking at [defender.GetTitledFirstName]'s eyes. For the first time tonight, you can really see these eyes clearly, making you cry to the bone. This is not the mortal [defender.GetTitledFirstName], but the dead [defender.GetTitledFirstName]. I will give you one more chance, [defender.GetSheHe] sighed. "It's no big deal, everyone will follow me in the end." Then, you blink, [defender.GetSheHe] puts a bowl of omelet rice in front of you. "Next time, we will meet again." Then, the death girl disappeared before your eyes. You look at the bowl of fragrant omelet rice in a shock, and you pick up the spoon awkwardly. "

So many things have not been completed, it’s probably too late to pick it up now. "General." Your head suddenly lifted up, staring at [defender .GetFirstName]'s eyes. For the first time tonight, you can really see these eyes clearly, which makes you freeze to your bones. The figure in front of you is not an ordinary [defender.GetManWoman], or even [defender.GetManWoman] at all. This is death, and you have not completely won from [defender.GetSheHe]. "It's time, [attacker.GetFirstName]", [defender.GetSheHe] sighed with satisfaction. "Your performance is not bad, but long sleep is still waiting for you." The boundless darkness envelops you. When you wake up again, you feel a splitting headache. Death did not completely harvest your life, but took you away. Half of the soul, your death has been irreversible. "
