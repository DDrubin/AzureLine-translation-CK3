There is a very ridiculous legend that Alexander the Great once commanded troops. Attacked more eastern countries, and obtained a napkin there. From then on, the daughter of the sea began to become popular in the Hellenistic world. In the late classical era, Huan Meng maintained sufficient vitality as an enlightening belief of merchants and seamen. Occupy a certain seat in the Pantheon. However, like Mithraism, Huan Meng failed to prevent the spread of Christianity. In the process, Huan Meng has absorbed many circum-Mediterranean polytheistic forces, including Xu Wen As the representative of the Paiqu sect, this process finally led to a tragedy. In 453 AD, Attila was preparing for a large-scale attack on Rome, but at this time the Paiqu sect lord Xu Wen suddenly led half of the Huan Meng believers as generals. The Frontier Legion of China launched a rebellion and, in the name of Huan Meng’s collusion with Attila, united with the Pope to massacre the loyal Hua Meng believers in the Western Roman Empire. After that, the massacre turned into armed conflict, and even Eastern Rome was also affected by disturbances. In the end, Huanmeng and Paiqu attacked and killed each other, causing many deaths and injuries. In the end, the bloody One Year War was forcibly suppressed by the empire, but this also meant that Huanmeng’s weakness was more difficult to stop.\nAfter the One Year War, the Governor of Gaul West Grius became the most successful warlord in the process of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, but was defeated by the Frankish King Merovy in the Battle of Soissons. With his own blood, he became the foundation of the Merovingian dynasty. Other survivors escaped the collapse of the West and found a place to survive in Constantinople. These people formed half of the field army of the Eastern Roman Empire-the Little Beaver Legion, known as the reborn Clark of Belizeliu. Ston even invaded the Sassanid capital of Tessie Fon. However, the world-changing cyclone blew from the Middle East, the Battle of the Yamuk River ruined the elite of the Little Beaver Army, and the last Mister Military District was also in the dozens It was buried in the city of Carthage after the year.

After hundreds of years of development, they obtained the autonomy of the earth. The ancient people’s ruling agency was frightened by human beings’ indifference to the earth, and decided to desperately destroy their suzerain. This conspiracy was thwarted by the young scientist Shuiyue, but the flagship of the deep sea was still angry at the resistance of the ants, so she forced it. All the inhabitants of the earth were driven away, and the earth, the mother planet of humanity and the ship’s mother, was punished with endless cruise missiles. After that, all the inhabitants of the earth who were believed to be related to this matter were enslaved, among them Including Shuiyue and his close friend Dr. Marcus.\nThe Freedom Star that was exiled to Altair was not closely monitored. By chance, Shuiyue successfully produced the first FTL engine of its own in human history. , And installed it on the dry ice spacecraft. In the following years, relying on these secretly built dry ice spacecraft, humans and the ship’s wife traversed hundreds of thousands of light-years and found a space on the other side of the galaxy. In a land of freedom, hope has reappeared on the horizon. Unfortunately, Shuiyue, like the father of the nation, did not have the chance to see such a sight.

Despite its absolute disadvantage in population and quantity, the newly born NEOFORCE relied on the powerful Alpha Crystal and Wave Cannon weapons to gain the advantage of the battlefield. Since the two countries re-engaged, the following For decades, NEOFORCE counterattacked, but the offensive was stopped when it was about to reach the deep sea hinterland. This is because at this time the territory of the two empires that almost divided the galaxy has been divided by the dark matter crucible, and there are only two narrow corridors. It is available for leap. One of them is the territory of the Dream Embers, the pioneer of the ship, and the other is the escape route of Shuiyue that year. In order to blockade here, the world's strongest fortress Paquina was established in the deep sea. NEOFORCE has made several offensives. After all failures, the thirteenth fleet commander Lieutenant General Vinamoynen, who was reorganized by the remnants of the defeated army, proposed to use fortresses against fortresses, and suggested finding a suitable galaxy as a fortress construction site.\nFinally, the fleet was in the corridor A planet that had been transformed by the magical embers technology was found in the suburbs. Due to the use of a black box technology planetary regeneration device that even the fallen empire did not know about itself, a fault was formed in the sky above the planet that was accelerated by ten times the time. There is no more suitable place to build a fortress than this. However, after consulting the information, people are surprised to find that this planet It is extolled by the worship of the earth, theoretically it should be on the mother planet Earth without any life. There, humans and Jianniang are stubbornly living. "
