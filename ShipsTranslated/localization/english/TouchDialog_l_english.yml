  Hood_TouchDialog_1:0 "There are always people who say that luck is a part of strength. For me, there is no such thing. Are you right, Commander?"
 Hood_TouchDialog_2:0 "Just leave it to me to train everyone, and you will surely be satisfied."
 Hood_TouchDialog_3:0 "Commander, you came just right, don't you want to have a cup of tea together?"
 Hood_TouchDialog_4:0 "(Whispering) Bismarck, why is luck always so good~"
 Hood_TouchDialog_5:0 "You must be tired after working so late? Is there anything I can help?"
 Hood_TouchDialog_6:0 "Every time I see Richelieu, there is always a trace of guilt in my heart..."
 Hood_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The commander called me? Could it be that the work can't be completed? Hehe, it's not impossible to help you, but I have to wait until my training is over."
 Hood_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Commander, how can you be so sloppy as a gentleman? Let me sort it out for you...rest assured, soon."
 Hood_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Commander, you...eh? Bi, Bismarck! Why are you here?...Huh?"
 Hood_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The wind at night is really a bit cool...Thank you Commander. Haha, this coat still has your body temperature, as if it were in your arms."
 Hood_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "This is the black tea I made by myself, do you like it?...Hehe, this is not something that everyone can drink~"
 Hood_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Tonight's black tea party... hee hee, it is held at Tianhou's house, do you want to go? However, there is one requirement-you can't stare at other girls!"
 Fusou_TouchDialog_1:0 "Ah, Gui'an, the admiral. Do you want to patrol the entire port area today? It's really hard work. It's not easy for you to stick to it."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_2:0 "The towering bridge can bring a wider view, which is very helpful during shelling. Huh? Radar? What is that?"
 Fusou_TouchDialog_3:0 "Huh? The direction seems to have changed, awful-cough cough cough... Only this heavy smoke can't get used to it anyway."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_4:0 "Listening to the sound of the waves scouring the reef, is there a unique feeling? Tranquility is not only felt when there is no sound."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_5:0 "If you add a flight deck, you will need to remove the main gun. No matter how you think it is a plan that does not pay off. I am proud of the firepower, but I won't just give up so easily."
  Fusou_TouchDialog_6:0 "Admiral, are you still awake? Ah, I didn't expect you were pretending to be asleep. What a wicked child, I almost kissed him. Hehe...just kidding~"
 Fusou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey, what are you looking at-horoscope divination... Thank you, I don't need it anymore. Because no matter how you measure it, the result will not change."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Unknowingly, it has been so long... I really want to go back to the battlefield and smell the smoke again... Let's forget the smoke in the chimney..."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I really want to raise a Zashiki boy~ But even if there is one, I can't see that child, so I can't thank her face to face. Alas, there is no best of both worlds in this world..."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Huh... there should be no one around, right? Let the eyes breathe a little bit... Well, after the vision is widened, I can't adapt. Once the "habit" is developed, it is not so easy to change it... ..."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "She always shook her head with a small screen at night, she didn't know what she was doing. If she was seen by others, she would think she had a seizure."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I don't have any special hobbies... Hey? Can swordsmanship count? Ordinary girls should prefer beautiful clothes, right? I... I don't care that much."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_1:0 "Woo... my shoulders are sore, if someone can helpah, the admiral, how can I let you do this kind of thing! I, I, I"
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_2:0 "Everyone can live together carefree. This is a situation I never dared to imagine. Thank you for making me look forward to this world again."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_3:0 "I have an overwhelming advantage in firepower, and I was born for this. But thinking about it, I don’t seem to be able to help now... Ah, it’s a headache."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_4:0 "The tide rises and falls, just like life. There are lows of failure, and there are high cabinets of success. Only hard work can change all this."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_5:0 "A cup of strong tea can dilute the misfortune that happened today, and it can also recall the pleasure of this body. Well, this is the "magic power" of tea."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_6:0 "After processing these documents, you can rest. I will cheer you on. Huh? This is not a joke."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Occasionally, I want to be like those destroyers, bouncing around in the port area, full of youthful vitality. Hey, no matter what you say, I am not a kid anymore..."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Do you want to drink matcha? Then come with me to taste the tea. That kid's tea ceremony is better than me, and I often go there to drink tea."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "When my sister is cooking, I usually help by the side. Although the dishes are not delicious, my knife skills are quite good."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "A reasonable use of the space in the hangar can also show good combat power. What's wrong? I didn't put snacks in the hangar, wait, don't lean over, what do you want to do?"
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "This is a popular handheld nowadays. It's fun. Although it was bought by a nasty advertisement, it was unexpectedly good."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Some people like to say something insincere~ When they are out, they stare at the dress in the window and refuse to leave, but they still have to say that they don’t like it at all. Huhu, this is also a kind of "cute" Right~"
  Ise_TouchDialog_1:0 "Haha, the admiral, you stared at me for so long, what do you want to do? But before that, let's enshrine some incense money~"
 Ise_TouchDialog_2:0 "It is not time to visit the shrine, and the shrine is not open~ Ah, if you are here to enshrine incense money, you can make an exception once! Just once!"
 Ise_TouchDialog_3:0 "Tsk... I always feel that my faith has fallen recently. It seems that I can only attack more so that they can see my active posture on the battlefield! Then they will swarm here~haha~"
 Ise_TouchDialog_4:0 "A carrier-based aircraft? Hmm... If you get it and use it proficiently, you may be able to attract a large number of believers! Hey! Looking forward to it~"
 Ise_TouchDialog_5:0 "Barrage shooting is a very refreshing thing~ Admiral, you can also try it when you have time~ I will teach you by myself, don't worry~"
 Ise_TouchDialog_6:0 "You don’t need to worry about things like torpedoes at all~ Just wait for it to get close and use a high-angle gun to solve it! I'm an expert in this respect~"

 Hyuuga_TouchDialog_3:0 "You have faith in your heart, so you can rely on it when fighting. So-come with me to visit my sister~"
 Hyuuga_TouchDialog_4:0 "Popularity is faith! As long as you collect enough popularity, faith will follow! Hmm! That's right!"

  Bismarck_TouchDialog_1:0 "Comprehensive protection is more trustworthy than unreliable key protection."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_2:0 "Don't waste firepower on trivial fish. Only taking the main force directly is the key to victory."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_3:0 "Did the sir see Tirbitz? It's obviously time for training, but I haven't seen her... Well, I don't know where to play again..."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_4:0 "Since it bears the crystallization of Deutsche Technology, we must work hard to make good use of this power."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_5:0 "Hood? Although her symbolic meaning is far greater than strength, she is unexpectedly strong and a respectable opponent."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_6:0 "Tilbitz, sooner or later will become a battleship alone, I am quite sure."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ahem, sir...Although I know you are very interested in my ship outfit, but you always poke and poke like this, which can be very troublesome..."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Fire!Drink!...whoop, sir, why are you here? Is this for me?! It's really troublesome...Thanks, thank you."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Tilbitz! Go and train with me!… Hmm ignore me? I’m going to kick the door, don’t regret it…"
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It's so warm...Thank you for your coffee, you won't be sleepy with this. Do you want to work... I shouldn't disturb you by the side... Well, I will be with you..."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "...Am I asleep? Really... I said that I wanted to accompany you, but I fell asleep...I...I'm really an inexhaustible person-your palm... so warm... It's always like this... I am almost becoming not myself..."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Habeing a pirate is great to be free! How about sir? Do you want to be a pirate with me when the war is over?"
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_1:0 "(Impatient) You continue to poke me, don’t I guarantee what will happen?"
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_2:0 "...(dozing)..."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_3:0 "Every time I hear the buzzing of an airplane, I feel uncomfortable."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's nighta new day begins!"
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_5:0 "...Are you not going to sleep yet? What a surprise..."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sir, have you heard of the existence of a fleet? Just as long as it exists, it can contain a large number of enemy fleets, just like me~"
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "...Why do you keep staring at me? Do I...do you care so much? Ah...Is that so...well, just do whatever you want..."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Is it okay not to supervise other people? Being with me here... is more important than official business...? What... You can say this kind of thing, I...maybe just happy..."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The recent serialization is boring... it's all kingly plots... occasionally, some novel themes are also coming out... comics... it's not that simple thing."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It's so warm...Thank you for your coffee, you won't be sleepy with this. Do you want to work... I shouldn't disturb you by the side... Well, I'll be with you..."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "...Am I asleep? Really... I said that I wanted to accompany you, but I fell asleep...I...I'm really an inexhaustible-your palm... so warm... it's always like this... I am almost becoming not myself..."

 Nelson_TouchDialog_1:0 "Commander, have you seen Rodney? I have something to find her...no, no! How can I trouble you!"
 Nelson_TouchDialog_2:0 "My eyes?...This is not an important thing, please don't care."
Nelson_TouchDialog_3:0 "The level of birth can only represent the achievements of the predecessors, and all we can do is make ourselves better."
  Nelson_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, are you okay tonight? That's right, let me tell you what should be done on the battlefield. Doing nothing on the battlefield like this is a pain."
 Nelson_TouchDialog_5:0 "My sister made Sandwich today, but there is no Sand...Huh? Isn't it funny?"
 Nelson_TouchDialog_6:0 "Although Rodney is usually gentle, don't underestimate her. After all, lucky gems may bring bad luck, the power of gentleness... please experience it yourself."
 Nelson_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Aim, fire, hit! Humphif it's just such a simple thing, then life is really boring, isn't it?"
 Nelson_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The commander is up? I just saw you sleeping soundly, so I didn't call you... By the way, did you see the black tea on the table? How did it taste?"
 Nelson_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I can't believe it. Rodney is getting stronger and stronger. If I play against her now, I'm afraid I have to do my best."
 Nelson_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Does the commander like to travel? If possible, let's go to the Cotswolds this summer. Believe me, it will be fun."
 Nelson_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huh-these jobs are just trivial things to me, on the contrary, if I don't do well, it will make people laugh..."
 Nelson_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Commander, are you born with a lack of romantic genes? In this way, it is impossible to capture the hearts of others. If you want to show your charm, you have to be like me... (slowly approaching) Understand? Baby~ "
 Rodney_TouchDialog_1:0 "Commander, have you been watching me training just now?...Can you please? Really?"
 Rodney_TouchDialog_2:0 "Commander, you can give me anything I need to do~ Rodney will come on!"
 Rodney_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hood is really a respectable predecessor, there are many things that I can learn from."
 Rodney_TouchDialog_4:0 "The port area at night is really peaceful, ah... Commander, good evening, won’t you catch a cold if you wear so little?"
 Rodney_TouchDialog_5:0 "My sister only knows responsibilities and responsibilities all day long. If she is so rigid, she would...Oh, what should I do? Commander, can you help me in this regard?"
 Rodney_TouchDialog_6:0 "In order to catch up with my sister...no, not to lose to the Sandman, huhu...I will work harder."
 Rodney_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey, commander, there is a small request...that, you can be my artillery...Oh! Commander, don't run!"
 Rodney_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Oh-I'm going to be late! Ahhhh-Commander, why didn't you wake me up!! You're going to be scolded by my sister again..."
 Rodney_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hey--! Commander, today I know another catch phrase that my sister likes to say~ Want to know?"
 Rodney_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "What a comfortable port area, I really want to live here with you..."
 Rodney_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, there are so many outstanding seniors, how did you choose me? I count it, gentle senior Hood, handsome sister and...Oh, why are you angry? I won’t say anything. That's it, hehe~"
 Rodney_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "If you let your sister wear feminine clothes, it will look good, commander, what do you think?"
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_1:0 "Not every dispute has to be resolved through combat. Only by persuading opponents in negotiations can you show your demeanor."
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_2:0 "It's really beautiful today, sir, come and have a drink together?"
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_3:0 "Whenever I fail, I firmly believe that it is not the so-called luck, but the lack of strength."
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's still early. Seeing you look in a hurry, do you have any secret things you are eager to solve?"
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_5:0 "The night is getting dark. Drinking a glass of red wine will help you sleep. Would you like a glass?"
  PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_6:0 "Your Excellency is really an excellent commander, your words and deeds are worthy of being recorded in the annals of history."
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Oh? Do you also like to drink a glass of sweet wine when you wake up in the morning? It seems that you are really a good companion."
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Compared to the exercise, I think it is more suitable for me to help you deal with the official documents... This is not an escape training, I just want to work with you, understand?"
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Commander, look at you in such a hurry, is there another dispute? Oh-leave it to me, just watch it from the side, it's time for me to show you what is unique Charm."
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "How would you like to taste this glass of wine?... Compared with the last time, do you have a different feeling? Red wine needs to be savored carefully. The taste between the lips and teeth is very different."
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hurry up and prepare, there will be a cocktail party to attend in a while. It is not good for your outfit to be regarded as my entourage. After all, the person I choose can be so casual."
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "You look tired. Is that the reason for me? Huh-am I too impatient? If you want to rest, remember to tell me that I will slow down... After all, there is only and You go forward together, and this journey is meaningful."
 Nevada_TouchDialog_1:0 "Leave me the security and security of the port area. I am here to ensure that the enemy will not dare to come, haha."
 Nevada_TouchDialog_2:0 "Even if you are in jail, as long as the boiler is still running, you must fight back fiercely, especially those flying in the sky."
 Nevada_TouchDialog_3:0 "Training? Really boring, come here, Commander, do you want to have an interesting game with me?"
 Nevada_TouchDialog_4:0 "This guy in Oklahoma is still a bit too compliant. Sometimes you don't need to pay too much attention to these rules, just follow your own ideas!"
 Nevada_TouchDialog_5:0 "Atlantic, Pacific, I really want to see it."
 Nevada_TouchDialog_6:0 "Protect the important things, and let the dice decide the rest. Nothing is more exciting than one-sixth of fate!"
 Nevada_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ah-it's already this time! Really, it's impossible for two sleepy guys to be on time together... Hey hey, I'm all awake, can't you get up?"
 Nevada_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Come, come, toss a coin, this can decide whether I will go to training today... Hey, I guessed it, luck is good, then I will not accompany you to training today... Hahaha, I I didn’t say before that I went to train if I guessed it~"
 Nevada_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Um-Commander, you are here to comment. Usually Omaha just takes away the things in my house. Just now she went to your house to take away a lot of things... No, I didn't. What is hiding in your house..."
 Nevada_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "This battle is really long, I really want to go to see all over the world. So...you and I will solve this stubborn enemy quickly, and then make the whole world a home!"
 Nevada_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Oklahoma asked me to accompany her for a drink. I'll go there first, Commander, you have to come together when you are done!"
 Nevada_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Ah, commander, when did you learn magic? Hiccuphhhhh, did the enemy invade? Look, look at me, open fire!"
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_1:0 "You can't fight for luck during the battle. You must deliver every bullet to the enemy."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_2:0 "The key defense is really uncomfortable. Obviously, injuries are fatal everywhere in the battle."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_3:0 "Did the commander see Nevada? Now it's my turn to patrol with her, but this guy doesn't know where he went."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_4:0 "That guy in Nevada...Although he is a good companion, he is always unruly, which is really a headache."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_5:0 "The quieter the night, the more you must be vigilant. Crisis often comes before dawn...Of course, with me by your side, there will be no problem."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_6:0 "Is the commander tired? Would you like to listen to the folk songs of my hometown? Although I do not sing very well."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "You can rest for a while, because you didn't cook often before, very, very unskilled, I will call you when the breakfast is ready...Wait, wait a minute...Hey, I am confused again..."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Bounty hunters are paid, so, if you perform well today, what kind of rewards will you give me?...I'm really looking forward to it."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Huh-relax today, hey, let's take a day off too, don't tire yourself out, I found a nice restaurant nearby. Let's try it together?"
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Are you also interested in taking a walk on the beach today?...Haha, I just like the scenery here. Every night listening to the evening bell, blowing the sea breeze, and occasionally chatting with people who pass by, it’s nothing more than this Something that makes people happy..."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It's okay to live a little more leisurely. It's just that I've been a bounty hunter for a long time, and my nerves are always tense. I suddenly relax and feel a little at a loss."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Tsk, I really drink a lot with Nevada, Commander, I'm sorry, I might have to take a break."
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_1:0 "Uh...how come the eyes of other battleships looking at me and Veneto are weird..."
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_2:0 "Training? Do I still need these for my strength?... But, for the sake of you begging me, I will just go for it."
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_3:0 "I'm a battleship with a lot of experience in many battles. I have to respect me and be called seniors, you know?...Don't call me "Xiao'an" anymore!"
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_4:0 "Who...who is a daughter! I am very mature!"
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_5:0 "Don't touch me casually."
  AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_6:0 "Huh? This work will take you so long? It's really useless!"
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hmph, these pediatric official documents, as long as this adult is a little serious, you canEh? Eh eh?! What is written on it! I don’t understand at all!!!"
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Um...I always think something is wrong? Wow! Where is the cat coming from here!? Don't catch my skirt! Card...Kayo! Come and help me get rid of it!!! Hurry up! !!!"
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Why... treat me so tenderly... You have never given you a good face... You are such a strange person... Huh? Like me? Suddenly, what are you talking about? ! I... I like it too! I like it!!!"
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Really...it feels like the heart is about to explode. But ah, I can say something like thatKayo, is this the feeling of love? You don’t know, ah..."
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huh...? What's wrong... Huh? This smell... Is there something smeared? Wow wow wow! Forgot to make the French fries!! Wow! The oil splashesit hurts. It hurts!!!"
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Ah? what is this dark one? What is this dark fries? what is it? It's not that you can't eat it! Give it to me!!!"
 Kongou_TouchDialog_1:0 "I am a graduate of the Orthodox Royal Naval Academy~ Admiral! Don't worry about the task and leave it to me!"
 Kongou_TouchDialog_2:0 "The admiral’s port area is really good, as clean and tidy as my home in Country E."
 Kongou_TouchDialog_3:0 "This beautiful counterattack! Oh, admiral! Have you also come to the exercise site? Very well, I will be on the court next! Time for the show!"
 Kongou_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's Timing to rest~ Me? I don't feel sleepy at all, because I have consumed a lot of black tea, haha~"
 Kongou_TouchDialog_5:0 "Dear sister~ cheer up! The night is still long! Let us tour the entire port area together~ Hey!"
 Kongou_TouchDialog_6:0 "Oh yo? Could this be yokan?! You are really the younger sister of the individual post, and my sister is so moved that I am about to cry!"
 Kongou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Each country has unique etiquette and traditions. In the eyes of ordinary people, this is probably a very cumbersome thing? I think it's quite interesting. After all, I can learn about different customs~"
 Kongou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Actually, I don't have to drink afternoon tea, I just can't change this habit for a while. Oh! Are the snacks ready? Then come and drink tea"
 Kongou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Ah! Forgot today's drill! Without me, those kids wouldn't lose, right!? Hey? Won? A big victory? No!!!!"
 Kongou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "For me, Sir Thurston is a great benefactor. Oh? Is your subtle look jealous? Haha, shouldn't it... hey? Are you angry?"
 Kongou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "This is not Hood’s cat, come here~ Hey! Don’t go! I’m not a bad guy!"
 Kongou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "A person's life is short and beautiful. It is because it is short that I want to leave a trace of my own existence in this world."

 Hiei_TouchDialog_2:0 "Hoo...How can we become stronger?"
 Hiei_TouchDialog_3:0 "My sister always tells me to be more confident... But what should I do?"
 Hiei_TouchDialog_4:0 "Confidence, self-confidence and self-confidence...what should I do...ah, Shibo? Do you have anything to say?"
 Hiei_TouchDialog_5:0 "What exactly should I do? I...in order not to burden everyone, I must not continue to do this...!"

 Haruna_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sister, your frivolous attitude must be corrected! Now that you have come back, get rid of the habit-ah! Don't suddenly... not a kid anymore!"
 Haruna_TouchDialog_3:0 "I have been able to fight until now. In addition to the help of these advanced equipment, more importantly, I have a firm belief. Regardless of victory or defeat, I must use my strength to the limit. Martial artists, never allow to back down. ."
 Haruna_TouchDialog_4:0 "The one in front is... Ah, the senior of the First Air War! Are you planning to watch the moon here? Seeing the number of wine glasses, she will come too. That’s great, then I wish you all a good time~ I will continue to tour It's the port area, goodbye."
 Haruna_TouchDialog_5:0 "The anti-aircraft performance of the triple bombs needless to say, but the damage to the barrel is also obvious... It is a piece of equipment that makes people love and hate, but you have to choose the right time to use it."
 Haruna_TouchDialog_6:0 "What are you looking for, Lord Admiral? Huh...? Torpedo tubes? I...I am a battlecruiser! I don't have that kind of equipment! It's true, please believe me."
 Haruna_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "As a warrior, I am confident that I have done my best. But in daily life...I really don’t have the confidence to say that I can take care of these. Can you teach me from scratch? I will work hard. Learn, trust me."
 Haruna_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Curry...prepare the ingredients, cut into pieces, put them in the pot, and boil them with water. Put the curry cubes in the appropriate time and continue to simmer...Um...it should be true, right? Okay, first cut into pieces -Ah!"
 Haruna_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sorry... for showing you the embarrassing side of me... It's shameful, it's just that simple cutting of vegetables will cut to myself... Thank you for helping me bandage the wound, that... that, if possible, can hold it forever Are you holding my hand? This way... I won't feel the pain..."
 Haruna_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Well, sister...do you have any special dishes? That...can teach me? I want to surprise the admiral who has treated me so tenderly. The happiness of my sister rests on you! Ask for advice I!"
 Haruna_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "What are you looking at? Hey? The recipes? Are they all prepared for me? I... I don't know what to say. I will not disappoint your expectations. I will try to make you Happy cooking! Before that, let's finish today's work~"
 Haruna_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Master God, please bless me... Haruna, I want to change. Not for myself, but for the admiral who has always been the same to me. This heart, Haruna must be rewarded. Not for the admiral, but for Myself... Lord God, please--"
 Kirishima_TouchDialog_1:0 "Did my sisters trouble you today? Please bear with the admiral~"
 Kirishima_TouchDialog_2:0 "Today's training is over...Hey, are you here, the admiral? Go find your sister, I think she will need your encouragement more."
 Kirishima_TouchDialog_3:0 "What a happy day, Admiral, how about going to have a snack together after work?"
 Kirishima_TouchDialog_4:0 "How about pretending to be sick tonight?... Well, occasionally I want to be a sister to be taken care of~"
 Kirishima_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sister, don't always be so inferior, okay, you know... Ah, the admiral, are you here to find your sister? Then I will find King Kong sister to play, hehe~"
 Kirishima_TouchDialog_6:0 "South Dakota? Ayanami has always wanted to fight her again, my word...hehe, it's better to stop it."

 Renown_TouchDialog_1:0 "Perfect completion of the task is the mission of the servant."
 Renown_TouchDialog_2:0 "The training with Miss Hood is really beneficial."
 Renown_TouchDialog_3:0 "I don't know who the opponent will be in today's exercise? It's really exciting."
 Renown_TouchDialog_4:0 "I have completed my work today. Is there anything else I can do for you, Commander?"
 Renown_TouchDialog_5:0 "I wish I could ride on the battlefield with Miss Hood.\n"
  Renown_TouchDialog_6:0 "Although Sister Shane was repelled by one enemy and two, this is nothing in the face of real victory."
 Renown_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Today's breakfast has been prepared for you, ooh...but it's almost lunch time...what a headache..."
 Renown_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Commander, is this the job for today? Well... it's okay, as long as it is handled within today, right?"
 Renown_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "If you have any difficulties in your work, please do not hesitate to give orders. I will definitely finish it smartly."
 Renown_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "In fact, not every E countryman is not good at cooking, my words... Royal butter chicken, will it meet your appetite?"
 Renown_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Are you tired? Let's take a break...well, I will feel bad for you to be so tired... I think these tasks should be completed soon."
 Renown_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "This night reminds me of the scenery of Scotland...Have you heard of "Scottish Fantasia"? Whenever I feel upset, I will listen to this song..."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_1:0 "Master, I seem to be in a good mood today. Have you encountered any interesting things?"
 Repulse_TouchDialog_2:0 "I will not be absent from daily training, and at the same time...Master, would you please work hard too?...You always come to see me for training. Yes, I'm a little embarrassed..."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_3:0 "The elegance and power of the predecessors are all examples for me to learn from."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_4:0 "Ah, are you awakened by me?... You go to rest, and leave the rest of the work to me."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_5:0 "This is a snack for you, please use it slowly... hee hee, how does it taste?"
 Repulse_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sister Prestige is really amazing, no matter what kind of task she can complete, when will I be like her..."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ah, are you awake? But the breakfast is not ready yet, ah-it's already boiling! You... please wait a moment, I, I will make it right away!"
 Repulse_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "It is really difficult to coordinate military training and your own job. OooCommander, what do you say I should do first?... 1. Staying by your side and saying this, won’t you blush? ?"
 Repulse_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Master, master, have I improved recently?...Hey, what are you blushing? Difficult, what are you thinking about..."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It’s not as good as my sister in doing anything...why--how did you find me under the brilliance of my sister? Although I am very happy, I still feel a little pressure..."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Um...this is embarrassing. I tried to make some desserts that you like. I don't know if I can ask you to taste it. I tasted it and I think it tastes good..."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Pointer, Commander, I want to be with you...with you...watching the sunrise, okay?...really? Thank you, hehe~ then, in return, I can...please, please close your eyes , Don't look at me!"
 Alaska_TouchDialog_1:0 "Heavy cruiser? Neither firepower nor armor can compare to me~ In this case, just learn how to hunt."
 Alaska_TouchDialog_2:0 "The escort training has been completed. To be honest, it's really boring..."
 Alaska_TouchDialog_3:0 "Commander, did you see Mitchell?...Oh, if you are looking for Guam, she is training with the aircraft carrier girls~"
 Alaska_TouchDialog_4:0 "Although it is much stronger than the average cruiser, it can't stand alone like South Dakota. It's really unpleasant..."
 Alaska_TouchDialog_5:0 "I always feel that there has been less and less battle between me and Guam recently. Commander, hunters have to keep looking for prey to grow!"
 Alaska_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, are you still busy? If you are sleepy, just...hehehe, my performance will make you excited~"
 Alaska_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Alaska_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Whenever and wherever, to face others with all enthusiasm is our best return to life. Of course, to the commander... 120% of the enthusiasm is needed to give back, so let's come together Sing aloud, Commander~"
 Alaska_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Today’s breakfast is butter bread... What do you say is the red color on the bread? This is not ketchup~ Because while listening to the song and adding ingredients, I put some chili sauce... You taste it, I think it tastes It should be pretty good, but this chili sauce is full of my love~"
 Alaska_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Guam is going to have a solo concert? Then I must go! Walk around, you also go with me! Bring the light stick, what else to bring... By the way, lozenges, you yell at me We have to work harder, we must cheer on Guam... Don't be in a daze! Go away!"
 Alaska_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The Gothic Lion is really a perfect partner...Of course, this is except for Guam. When playing with Guam, no matter how intense the genre is, it can be neutralized by her performance and become almost perfect. ."
 Alaska_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Want to hear my gentle performance? That's fine. But...it's been a long time since I listened to this kind of music, can you sing me a song of this type? Listen to me."
 Alaska_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "You said, we are so noisy at night, will it upset the gods in the sky... Then... are you afraid? If you are not afraid, we will party till dawn!"
 Guam_TouchDialog_1:0 "Although the daily training is boring, as long as there is still a trace of possible use, we must not slack off."
 Guam_TouchDialog_2:0 "Fire...! Ahhh... I twisted my ankle again... It hurts..."
  Guam_TouchDialog_3:0 "Alaska gets too excited sometimes. If you accidentally do something wrong, please forgive me from the commander."
 Guam_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, if it's convenient, can you please help me back to where I live... my feet hurt, uh..."
 Guam_TouchDialog_5:0 "The commander really works hard, and I can't lag behind. Please look forward to my progress."
 Guam_TouchDialog_6:0 "Even if it is against the J National Super A cruiser, Alaska and I will not be afraid of it at all."
 Guam_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "A warm sunny day is suitable for playing happy music, a cold wind and rainy day is suitable for playing intense music, and if you are by my side...I just want to play the music you like."
 Guam_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Fighting is not just for killing. It is necessary to find the rhythm of the battle on the battlefield. Each battle is also a performance, so that we are distinguished from the beasts that only kill."
 Guam_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Commander, can you accompany me for a while? I have a personal concert tonight... This is the first time I will play separately with my sister. It's a bit nervous... Please don't leave me before going on stage..."
 Guam_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It hurts... It hurts... I know it's my fault to be strong, but I just don't want you to worry... Okay, I see, I will take care of my wounds, No... This is the ointment for Miss Kitchen God. …Can you paint it for me?"
 Guam_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Intense music and behavior can also express tender emotions, don't you believe it? Then, let me show it to you. How about (kiss)? Do you feel it?"
 Guam_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The night is really fascinating, especially the most exciting and romantic thing in the world to break this supposedly peaceful night with passionate music."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_1:0 "Is this a strong wind? The child seems to be shining with golden light, so amazing"
 Akagi_TouchDialog_2:0 "The younger generations are getting better and better. It's really worth being happy."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_3:0 "You seem to have nothing to do, I'm going to help the expedition team, why not let me go together?"
 Akagi_TouchDialog_4:0 "The Minato area surrounded by moonlight is really fascinating... If it is accompanied by a glass of sake at this time... ahem..."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_5:0 "After drinking, my sister sometimes says something childish. You should not hear it, please."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_6:0 "To spend every day and night peacefully is what we are fighting for on the battlefield."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Gui'an, Lord Admiral. Can you go to the beach with me? Nothing special, just a sudden interest. I guess you will not refuse. Haha, I know."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Kaga, how about you occasionally try to use juice instead of wine? This is not just for your health. Don't be so stubborn-ah, gone... I'm sorry, Admiral, let you laugh Yes. She will definitely understand."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "How about you occasionally try to substitute fruit juice for wine? It's not just for your health. Don't be so stubborn-ah, gone... I'm sorry, the admiral, you laughed. She laughed. Yeah, you will understand. Definitely."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The busy day is finally over. Do you have any other orders? If not, can you accept my little "request"? You shouldn't refuse it~"
 Akagi_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Successful infiltrating the wine cellar~ Well, let me see where Kaga hides the wine... I found it~ She really hides a lot of it... Admiral, can you drink two with me next? Don't worry. , It won't delay work~"
 Akagi_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "What do you think you are missing now? Only by finding this can you truly understand yourself. Only by understanding yourself can you release your true power. Next, it depends on your choice."
 Kaga_TouchDialog_1:0 "It is a great pleasure to fight against enemy chiefs on the battlefield."
 Kaga_TouchDialog_2:0 "I have a close friend. Rather than go to the battlefield hand in hand, there are few enemies among the enemy bandits."
 Kaga_TouchDialog_3:0 "The old language is really interesting...but the grammar is so difficult...the admiral?! Yu...what Yu Fangcai said... didn't you hear it?"
 Kaga_TouchDialog_4:0 "In this situation, how about having a few drinks with Yu?"
 Kaga_TouchDialog_5:0 "The night is drowsy, it makes people feel a little tired... just casually mentioned, casually mentioned..."
 Kaga_TouchDialog_6:0 "I still need to learn a lot, the grammar is a mess... Akagi is not willing to teach me... ooh..."
  Kaga_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Those destroyers are more worthy of your help than the rest. Don’t hesitate, just pass now. With this ring, I can feel you no matter where you are. "Lonely" , It’s not what Yu is good at."
 Kaga_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Winemaking is also very particular about it, just like-even if you say it, I can't rest assured that you can stay alone in that kind of place. Although winemaking is fun, if you get rid of your heart and soul by the wine hook, it is not Interesting."
 Kaga_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hello, Admiral. Yu is drawing the spells that will be used in the next battle. With this, you can quickly understand the wear and tear of the carrier aircraft. What? Do you think this is used to summon the carrier aircraft? Hehe, it's kind of interesting, it's worth a try."
 Kaga_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "A few cups of sake, a ray of candlelight. It seems poor, but quiet. This situation is like a dream and fantasy. Oh, I said something strange, please don't care. Come on, have another glass. "
 Kaga_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Do you ask us why we are obsessed with the starry sky? In the old days, when night came, only Akagi and this endless starry sky accompany me. It has witnessed all this and illuminates the way forward for our generation. What about such a starry sky? Can people not be obsessed? However, your existence nowadays is more than this starry sky. For Yu, eternity remains the same."
 Kaga_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The honor of this body is bestowed by you. I should do my best to protect this world forever. Um... I seem to be a little overwhelmed with alcohol, so I blushed..."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hmm, that's it. Go ahead, I'm listening. I'm definitely not lying to you, I swear."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_2:0 "Well, yes, it's a mission, right. I'll tell Senior Xianghe, wait, why is my name on the list?"
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_3:0 "The familiar children are not there, the atmosphere is really bleak. I didn't accuse you, it's true."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_4:0 "You asked me what I was holding? It's just something to reassure myself, there is no special choice. Today, it is the chocolate bar that Senior King Kong gave me, eh."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_5:0 "Well, these two knives are not decorations, they are genuine weapons. It's just that they haven't been used for a long time, I'm afraid the technique of knives has regressed."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_6:0 "Managing paperwork is an interesting job, at least for me. Of course, it's only "management", and it won't work if I want to review it."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "It doesn't matter what I have in my mouth. It can be straw or candy. But in the final analysis, they are just items used to confuse the enemy. Well, occasionally they can also relieve greedy."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Thanks to the aircraft carriers, I have plenty of free time. I don't have to get the order to attack as soon as I get to my mouth, and then toss until the night to come back, ah~ it's so easy~"
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I heard that there is a "Swordsman" in the port area? If this rumor is true, I really want to fight her. There has been no suitable opponent, the sword will become dull."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "A reasonable use of the space in the hangar can also show good combat power. What's wrong? I didn't put snacks in the hangar, wait, don't lean over, what do you want to do?"
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "This is a popular handheld nowadays. It's fun. Although it was bought by a nasty advertisement, it was unexpectedly good."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Some people like to say something insincere~ When they are out, they stare at the dress in the window and refuse to leave, but they still have to say that they don’t like it at all. Huhu, this is also a kind of "cute" Right~"
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_1:0 "Even if there is no advantage in the capacity of the hangar, as long as you train hard and increase your overall training level, there will always be tasks that can only be completed by our light flight."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_2:0 "Hello, senior. Are you here for a test flight of the new crew? Please let me participate, please."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_3:0 "Strength can't be concluded from the flight deck alone. Although most of the time, it is indeed that way. Tsk."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_4:0 "Night-time take-off operations are barely able to be done, but for the sake of carrier-based aircraft, it is better not to try it lightly."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_5:0 "Ah, why are you out for a walk so late-eh? Are you looking for senior? I just seemed to see her going there..."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_6:0 "Who am I supposed to be, it turns out to be the admiral. Sorry, one side's vision is slightly restricted, which makes people a little nervous."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Thank you for your concern, my eyes are fine. It's just that the color of the pupils may cause anxiety to other companions. So, I chose the most secure method."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Some things cannot be changed with acquired effort. But without effort, nothing can be done."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The experience accumulated in actual combat is faster and more memorable than the exercise. That being said, the role of the exercise cannot be ignored."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Whhhh. ..."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "She always shakes her head with a small screen at night, she doesn't know what she is doing. If she is seen by others, she must think she has a seizure."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I don't have any special hobbies... Hey? Can swordsmanship count? Ordinary girls should prefer beautiful clothes, right? I... I don't care that much."
 Argus_TouchDialog_1:0 "Although I don't have much outstanding ability myself, it is not a problem to train the aircraft carrier ladies."
 Argus_TouchDialog_2:0 "Actually I still have a name called Kagis... I hope no one will remember."
 Argus_TouchDialog_3:0 "The earliest in history? I want an elegant title for myself."
  Argus_TouchDialog_4:0 "Yo~ Commander has worked hard, let me complete the next work with you."
 Argus_TouchDialog_5:0 "The aircraft carrier ladies are very good, and they can't be sloppy in preparing lessons every day. Hey, I can't get too busy... Can the commander help me?"
 Argus_TouchDialog_6:0 "If you become stronger, you will have more opportunities to participate in actual combat, right?"
 Argus_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey hey hey, get up! Don't think I will relax the standard for you. My requirements for my partner are even more demanding! When will you be lazy?!"
 Argus_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Train carefully, don't be lazy! Hey, when did you arrive, Commander? Wait, you are here at this time... but lazy behavior!"
 Argus_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Ah~ the sun is really comfortable, let me rest on your lap, hehe, just one hour~ not lazy, just a lunch break~"
 Argus_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "These desserts are for you. They are rewards for today's hard work. Hey, please keep it up~"
 Argus_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Ahem-Commander, although I don't care, it is better for your behavior to be restrained in public now... I, as a teacher, have to maintain my dignity..."
 Argus_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh-it feels great to have a big meal with you after a busy work!"
 Langley_TouchDialog_1:0 "The training feels still insufficient, and there is no way to compare it with other aircraft carriers..."
 Langley_TouchDialog_2:0 "Obviously being the first aircraft carrier is a very glorious thing, but it also has many flaws because of it..."
 Langley_TouchDialog_3:0 "Although I am not very good at combat, I can rest assured that such tasks as reconnaissance and patrol can be handed over to me."
 Langley_TouchDialog_4:0 "The commander's job is really hard, if I can share the worries for you, it would be great."
 Langley_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sister Lexington's strength... is really enviable."
 Langley_TouchDialog_6:0 "I was originally used for transportation, so I am not very good at many combat skills, except for finding enemies..."
 Langley_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Students are very naughty... so are you, don't help me control them... It's a bit too much to control them by myself, don't laugh, come and help me move something, okay?"
 Langley_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Give me the water? Thank you... next time can you join me in classing these little guys?... I'm too weak, I can't help it, especially the one named Saratoga... Too naughty NS……"
 Langley_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Corporation, Saratoga, why are you two quarreling again, don't you feel bored about who is stronger every day? ... If you really want to compare, let's perform well on the battlefield next time."
 Langley_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Do you need me to do something for you?... Then, what can I do? If I can do it, I will try my best."
 Langley_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, can you tell me the reasons for choosing me as the object of the vow?...No, but although I have the title of number one, I don't have my own skills. When facing younger generations... I was thinking , Perhaps, you discovered my strengths so"
 Langley_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "People go from ignorance of the sea to fear, and then continue to explore now. It is really amazing. Just like you and I never realize now, what is the reason that brought us together?"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_1:0 "Be full of energy every day!"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_2:0 "Come on~! Come on~!"
Ranger_TouchDialog_3:0 "Huh-it's nice to take a break occasionally~!"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_4:0 "No matter how late, I will accompany you and cheer for you!"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_5:0 "Drinking a glass of milk at night will help you sleep~"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_6:0 "When can I become a regular aircraft carrier... I hope I can help you..."
 Ranger_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The raiders are going to train. Please drink up the chocolate milk prepared for you~!"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The Raiders are also training well today! Commander, I will definitely become stronger for you!"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "In a casual afternoon, can you accompany me for a walk?... Hey, I want to go and play with the children for a while!"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Is the commander still working?... (whispering) It seems that today is very hard, um-let's prepare some desserts for my dear!"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It's great to be able to help you. Although not as versatile as the other sisters, I am a master of hot chocolate! Try it!"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The child is so cute, Commander~Commander~Official~you said that? So...hee hee~"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_1:0 "It's really beautiful today, the commander, would you like to go for a walk with me?"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_2:0 "I have prepared lunch for the commander, but should I wash my hands first?"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_3:0 "Actual combat is not the same as an exercise. Even if you perform well in the exercises many times, you still cannot count as real combat effectiveness without actual combat experience."
 Lexington_TouchDialog_4:0 "Huh~ The sea breeze tonight is really comfortable, can the commander walk with me?"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_5:0 "Are you still working? Really hard work. I'll give you a cup of coffee and take a break."
 Lexington_TouchDialog_6:0 "Saratoga is so naughty, pretending to be me and making trouble every day... Hey, when will we grow up..."
 Lexington_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Commander, it's impossible to be so at a loss every day. Hey... come on, relax, I will always be by your side."
 Lexington_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Well-in this way, I will make an agreement with you. If the commander is always obedient, I will fulfill one of your wishes, how?... Hee hee, as long as I can do it, anything can be done. !"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hey, the commander is as naughty as a child. However, it's pretty cute~"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "(stretching) the work is finally completed, hehe, the next step is time for you and me~"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, I'll help you...ah! Shhh, it seems that someone is eavesdropping."
 Lexington_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Do you also like to blow the sea breeze at night? Be careful, don't catch cold, I will bring you a coat, so put it on."
  Saratoga_TouchDialog_1:0 "My sister is so powerful and gentle, no wonder everyone likes my sister... I like my sister too!"
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_2:0 "Commander, you have identified the wrong person again. I am Lexington, not Saratoga... Hehe, now I am going to rest~"
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_3:0 "If only the destroyer and the cruiser are approaching, my sister and I are confident that we will repel the opponent. Please rest assured, the commander."
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_4:0 "At night, I can't see clearly in many places. If I get lost, it won't be good. If-if someone sends me-ah, the commander will send me back? Then you can rest assured. Hee hee~"
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_5:0 "My sister is so powerful, even if I occasionally slacken off, you shouldn't be angry, hehe~"
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_6:0 "Although I have gone through so many exercises, I still feel nervous before each battle... Fortunately, the commander and sister are by my side."
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey, Commander, I just pretended to be like my sister. I successfully lied to so many people. Hey... You don’t look very happy. Okay, I know that I can’t lie to you, so how do you punish? And me?"
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "My sister does everything so well, there is no need for me to work hard...Anyway, everyone doesn't pay attention to me...well, you are the one who cares about me besides my sister! Are you satisfied?"
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sleeping away quietly...Ah! You, you, you, you, you, why are you here?! Commander, you should work hard at this time instead of coming to me! You can't like me any more! Cough cough... I just feel like you will sneak away I came out to catch you!"
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Commander, the sea breeze is so refreshing and refreshing... Hey, what are you laughing at, I am Lexington! Why are you laughing too much! Is it so different?!"
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Are you busy? Then I won't bother you, I'm out to play...ahhhh, let me go~"
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "If I hadn't had a sister, would I be in the eyes of everyone...ahhh, no, I must have broken my brain..."
 Hornet_TouchDialog_1:0 "The excursion with the corporate sister was really a pleasant experience."
 Hornet_TouchDialog_2:0 "As long as you are with your two sisters, no matter how powerful the enemy you are, there is nothing to fear."
 Hornet_TouchDialog_3:0 "Did the commander see Northampton? It's strangejust saw her training here."
 Hornet_TouchDialog_4:0 "The child in Northampton is really good at taking care of others, but unfortunately his personality is weaker... I'm really afraid that she will be bullied."
 Hornet_TouchDialog_5:0 "You don't necessarily have to attack face-to-face at all times during the battle. In fact, it is good to occasionally make surprise attacks on the weakest place of the enemy's defense."
 Hornet_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, for a better tomorrow, we must not only work hard, but also take a good rest."
 Hornet_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The whole team! Take off--! Hey~ Commander, is the Hornet's posture in flying planes getting more and more adept?...Ah really! Where are your eyes looking! Fool! Pervert!"
 Hornet_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I was full of enthusiasm when I thought of training with the enterprise sister today, huh, let's dance and warm up... eh... eh eh eh?! Enterprise enterprise enterprise sister! When did you hide out of the window!! Huh, this posture? I hate it, haha, this is just the legendary Eastern Kungfu~ No! And here is the second floor, come in quickly!?!"
 Hornet_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Woo, no, don't take away the B25 of the Hornet ahh? Is the commander awake yet...hhhw For a while. The big B25 of the Hornet~"
 Hornet_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Miss Northampton is coming to play tonight~ Do you want to take us to eat? Hee hee, don't perfunctory."
 Hornet_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander! Commander! Officer! Say it! Did you steal the B25 of the Hornet again and put it in those IJNs! It's not for you to use it, just don't give other girls our beloved crystallization, OK? In this way, Bumblebee is going to become rebellious! I really want to become a bad girl."
 Hornet_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "First pull off the switch in the house, then hide behind the sofa, wait until the commander enters the room, and fall from behind! How about? The perfect surprise plan taught by the corporate sister! Huh...? Commander, Commander Officer, what's wrong with you? Wake up! (Crying) Commander--!"
 Takao_TouchDialog_1:0 "If this power can help you, it is my greatest praise."
 Takao_TouchDialog_2:0 "Maybe there is a huge disparity in power, but you can't give up lightly. Before the outcome is decided, everything may change."
 Takao_TouchDialog_3:0 "Strengthening the air... really an enviable direction."
 Takao_TouchDialog_4:0 "Is it okay to leave the night defense to me? Well, I will take this task seriously."
 Takao_TouchDialog_5:0 "Cooking is a very difficult skill... Is it too late to start training now?"
 Takao_TouchDialog_6:0 "Various documents are the expression of the strength of the mansion. This is the so-called "those who can do more."
 Takao_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "No matter what happens, there is always a solution. Even if one person cannot do it, as long as I call, I will be by your side to solve your problems."
 Takao_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The meager power, I hope you don’t dislike it. If the power bound by the treaty can be unlocked, it will definitely help you better..."
 Takao_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Even if I don’t participate in the battle, I hope I can contribute to this port area in my own way. In order to repay you, in order to repay everyone who lives here together, even if I offer all of my--yes It is incumbent."

  Atago_TouchDialog_1:0 "The opportunity to be able to express yourself on the battlefield must be seized, but you can't stay in the port area forever."
 Atago_TouchDialog_2:0 "I was really nervous when I was a frigate, but when I thought of being entrusted with a heavy responsibility, the tension disappeared."
 Atago_TouchDialog_3:0 "Even heavy cruisers have their own unique features."
 Atago_TouchDialog_4:0 "I really want to have a supper at this time. Appetite grows over time. Have you heard of this theory?"
 Atago_TouchDialog_5:0 "What time is it now? Why are there still destroyers hanging out outside? Really, discipline must be observed."
 Atago_TouchDialog_6:0 "Drowsiness is coming up...not at all. It's just a white lie to keep you focused~"
 Atago_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "My "strictness" is not pretended, do you want to experience it for yourself? You are always bound by something meaningless, that is, your weakness. Tsk, just like this treaty, hateful."
 Atago_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ah, I always feel full of resentment, what is wrong with me? Maybe this is the real me? How is it possible... something must be wrong... Admiral, what do you think?"
 Atago_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Making simple things more complicated is my strength, haha, does it sound awkward? I just want everything to be done without any omissions. This way, although the efficiency will be reduced, but absolutely There will be no unnecessary trouble. Well, the so-called "slow work makes meticulous work"."
 Atago_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "There are more conversations? Haha, I am not to mention how happy I am to communicate with you. Of course, if you are too long-winded, I will also control myself. Well, it's all up to you."
 Atago_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Day and night personality changes are not uncommon. The body and tense nerves after a busy day finally ushered in an opportunity to relax at night. No one will miss it. Now I want to lie in your arms Acting like a little girl--ah, isn't it too naive?"
 Atago_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Well, the review is complete. Congratulations on your completion of today’s work, and you can finally rest. As a secretary ship, thanks to your blessings, I can also take a rest. I hope I can still live in each other’s dreams. See you, good night, my admiral."
 Maya_TouchDialog_1:0 "Isn't this the admiral, it's still the same. But I haven't seen it for a while, and it's impossible to become mature suddenly."
 Maya_TouchDialog_2:0 "Limited by rules and regulations, what fun is there in such a life? Breaking the shackles with your own strength is a happy life."
 Maya_TouchDialog_3:0 "As long as there is a commensurate strength, the so-called "arrogance" is also a kind of praise."
 Maya_TouchDialog_4:0 "To win by playing clever, that is not a real victory."
 Maya_TouchDialog_5:0 "You are still teasing your subordinates tirelessly at night, are you busy with work? If you continue like this, you will be no different from waste."
 Maya_TouchDialog_6:0 "Isn't this shelved a lot of documents, you really are not working seriously. "Admiral"-this position does not seem to be suitable for you."
 Maya_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Achieving what ordinary people can't do is naturally worthy of praise. But what can you do with your body? Oh? Really? Then surprise me and show me all of you."
 Maya_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "It's amazing, your perseverance. But what can you change with perseverance alone? What can't even be done by me, you... don't try it. Injury is not a good thing... "
 Maya_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "What a stubborn person, you made me look at me a little bit. Okay, I admit your talent. But don't try that thing again. You always come back bruised and bruised, and my heart... also hurts. ..."

 Choukai_TouchDialog_1:0 "As long as I stay the way I am, it will be strong enough. I will give priority to my sisters and others for the transformation."
 Choukai_TouchDialog_2:0 "Being popular is not a good thing. If I was branded just because I received a special person, how could I win the battlefield?"
 Choukai_TouchDialog_3:0 "Occasionally I will be teased by my sisters...Although it's a bit hard, I don't get angry. The time spent with relatives is an extremely precious memory."
 Choukai_TouchDialog_4:0 "I have a little experience in night warfare, and I will never let you down. But now it's peace time, am I a bit too nervous..."
 Choukai_TouchDialog_5:0 "My sisters are so handsome when they say those incomprehensible things... Um! I didn't say anything! Admiral, you didn't hear anything, did you?!"
 Choukai_TouchDialog_6:0 "These written documents are a keynote no matter how long they are, and they are very easy to handle."
 Choukai_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sisters always take special care of me, ah, but they really worry too much! I'm not a kid anymore! Admiral, don't you say it? Hey, it's better for you. I treat it as a child."
 Choukai_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "If you want to grow, you have to learn to let go. Kaohsiung sister, there is no need to keep staring at me... These trainings have been done countless times, and there will be no mistakes. Normal heart, normal heart~"
 Choukai_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Did you even run over to supervise me? Hey, why is this happening... In short, as long as you become stronger, you won't worry about it! Wait for me, and I will definitely become stronger for you watch!"

 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_2:0 "Training can't be neglected, otherwise...you will be bullied on the battlefield."
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hmm... They are really two headache sisters..."
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_4:0 "Ah! Long, sir... Why did you come in! I, I am not watching the children's show, yes, it just happened to be changed!"
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_5:0 "The world itself is the weak and the strong, there is nothing right or wrong..."
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sir~~Do you want to know Blücher’s secret? Hehe~"
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sir, do Blücher and I seem to be the perfect pair?... As for Prince Eugen, she is different, she is different, she is the one we want to protect."
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Oh? It's my turn to go out on patrol today, my hands are itchy, hum~ Deep seas, tremble, I'm going to hunt you!"
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Damn...Why would I almost lose to that little guy in this situation! Sir, tell me, where am I inferior to that little guy? I'm really worried."
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Hey, sir--! I just saw the look in your eyes when you chatted with Miss Lexington... I didn't expect it, you are so sloppy... Why is your face so red? You look like a child. Just as shy."
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I'm going out to have fun tonight, don't worry, I will be back soon!"
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Leave some sweets for the little guy. She should like it very much... But if she comes to you and wants to return it to me, you can eat with her... Well, this is my carefully selected one."
 Blucher_TouchDialog_1:0 "Following the big sister training, there will always be endless fun! The sir, do you want to be together!"
 Blucher_TouchDialog_2:0 "Karlsruhe, Königsberg, let's rush together! Even if it's just a drill, you have to be bold!"
 Blucher_TouchDialog_3:0 "It's really the best thing for everyone to be together lively..."
 Blucher_TouchDialog_4:0 "The enemy's defense at this level is actually not enough."
 Blucher_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sir-official! Let's go to the Bismarck and their party together! It will be fun!"
 Blucher_TouchDialog_6:0 "Is my blush red? Nothing!"
 Blucher_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sir, I'm tired of eating those things every morning. Would you like an orthodox German breakfast?"
 Blucher_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Oh? Someone can wound Hipper like that?... At least it must be a battleship or the same heavy cruiser?... Destroyer? How can this be done! I don't believe it!"
 Blucher_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Is this the coastal defense artillery in the port area? It looks a little unbeatable..."
 Blucher_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Oh, Hipper loves pranks so much! She is a big sister, but she doesn't look like a sister... What?! She told you my size!... Sir, sit down first, I'll go out and do something. ."
 Blucher_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huh-finally escaped back, I really don't like places like bars, it's so noisy... Or sir, you are here, hey, quiet."
 Blucher_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The ring...I will look at it every time I am confused. Hehe, I feel at ease inexplicably."
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_1:0 "I will do my best, hope my efforts can help you..."
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_2:0 "Train hard, you can't be a dragger..."
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_3:0 "Ah-wallet? I found the wallet again, this time...who dropped it?"
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_4:0 "I helped everyone again today, I am really happy..."
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_5:0 "Huh-huh-ah! I didn't fall asleep... I, I'm just adjusting my breathing!"
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_6:0 "When you are resting...Nor can you relax your vigilance... (snooze)"
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Even if it is Bismarck's offense, I will try to block it..."
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The confusion in my heart seems to be somewhat solved..."
  PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "You, what do you seem to be worrying about, I think it's time for me to play... Maybe... "
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Spent another day with the commander today... (whispering) So, is this the feeling of happiness?..."
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It's okay, I'm not tired, let's go back together after your work is over."
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It seems that these things are not that difficult, but... Am I being too arrogant?"
 Wichita_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hmm~Who wants to compare the firepower with my Super Wichita?"
 Wichita_TouchDialog_2:0 "Why, as a heavy cruiser, I am about the same tonnage as the Brooklyn class..."
 Wichita_TouchDialog_3:0 "Commander, are you very energetic today, how about breaking your wrists with me?"
 Wichita_TouchDialog_4:0 "In addition to strengthening the caliber of firepower, there should be other ways to strengthen artillery attacks..."
 Wichita_TouchDialog_5:0 "The weak armor is still a bit worrying, it will be penetrated accidentally during battle."
 Wichita_TouchDialog_6:0 "I was the one who sunk an aircraft carrier. I know exactly what weakness the aircraft carrier has."
 Wichita_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hmph, this firepower is not enough to see, no matter who it is, let me see your firepower!...Hey, that is...Jean Barr? Hey! Are you free?"
 Wichita_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "As long as the enemy appears in front of me, I am obligated to fight constantly, haha, how enjoyable this life is!"
 Wichita_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "New Orleans, just thinking about guarding is not enough, only constantly attacking... hey, why don't you listen to it, offense is the best defense... Come on, Commander, you come to judge, who is better? Is it correct?"
 Wichita_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I'm not very good at speaking soft words, but my only advantage is that he has a lot of firepower. Whoever dares to approach you, I will let them know how strong my love for you is."
 Wichita_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It is said that as long as you get angry, you will become stronger, or else...I want to find a way to get you to be taken away by the deep sea once...Haha, just kidding."
 Wichita_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It's really a headache to help you deal with these things, I'll go out to get some air, hehe, by the way, see if the guy in New Orleans is willing to help."
 Quincy_TouchDialog_1:0 "I wanted to find my sister in New Orleans... but where is this place?"
 Quincy_TouchDialog_2:0 "Hey? Why do you look at Quincy with that expression? The window glass is broken? No, I don't know! Quincy doesn't know anything!"
 Quincy_TouchDialog_3:0 "Woo... Quincy is so hungry... Is there anything to eat, Commander... Don't find strange things to recharge!"
 Quincy_TouchDialog_4:0 "The headache at night is the inability to distinguish between the enemy and us at the first time. It is very dangerous to open fire rashly at this time..."
 Quincy_TouchDialog_5:0 "Huh...huh...Kuncy...Quincy...I'm so full..."
 Quincy_TouchDialog_6:0 "Everyone takes care of me, I really like everyone..."
 Quincy_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Today's task-to accompany the commander~! Start! Quincy will work hard!"
 Quincy_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "What is today's lunch~? What is it? Hey, just leave it to the commander! Quincy only needs to be responsible for tasting the delicious food."
 Quincy_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I am so lazy and the port area is also so peaceful. Doesn't it prove that everyone is very good? Do you think it is Commander?"
 Quincy_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Commander, you look a little unhappy today...or else, if you pinch Quincy's face, Quincy can make a face for you~"
 Quincy_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander! Don't always look at other girls when you are with me, OK! Especially the black long straight who likes to sing!"
 Quincy_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It seems that everyone likes the silly me, is that right? Commander, how about you?...Kun?"
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_1:0 "Resources need a little accumulation to reach saturation."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_2:0 "Admiral, please don't be too big, the resources are all the hard work of the expedition team."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_3:0 "I have been with the destroyers for a long time, and I feel like I am about to become the king of kids..."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_4:0 "The destroyers should go to sleep, too. Well, stretch your body and go to patrol the port area."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_5:0 "Being busy is not a bad thing, at least you can feel that you are alive to the full. Admiral, isn't it the same for you."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_6:0 "Live in the present and dedicate all of yourself to those children. This is the creed of who I am now."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Once the sword is out of its sheath, it will return in blood. From the moment the sword is forged, this destiny has been embedded in its roots, cruel and beautiful. This world, why not Is that so?"
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The rules and regulations are just a piece of paper made by people. Having said that, the rules are the rules. Now that they have been made, they must be followed."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The era of swords is a thing of the past, and the sword skills that once relied on have become unworthy "specialties." Fortunately, you and the children are here, and this world is worth my nostalgia. , What am I talking about..."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Keep some small animals... it sounds good, but it is also a pastime to relieve fatigue during the expedition. I don't know what those children like... cats? Or birds?"
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "A bowl of white rice and a plate of soy sauce are already treasures in my eyes. The more dull it is, the more popular it is."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "You have done a good job. If you continue with this progress, the piled files can be processed in only three days. It is really gratifying. However, if you need help, please feel free to bring it up. You don't have to force it."
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_1:0 "The towering trees grow by little by little every day."
  Tatsuta_TouchDialog_2:0 "Reasonable allocation of resources is also a compulsory course for the admiral."
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_3:0 "As long as you save a little every day, it will become an unexpected gain in time."
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_4:0 "Those kids are very interesting. Thanks to them, the expedition will not be bored at all. Rather, it is still a pleasure."
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_5:0 "It’s not easy to get them to sleep. After all, children are the children of the night, and their energy seems to be endless. Speaking of which, it’s really a headache."
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_6:0 "Can't you sleep either? Oh, you look like a child in a strange place. Well, it's not bad~"
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 ""I want to change the world and let dawn return to this land. "Some idiot once said something like this. One day she suddenly understood that she and the sword alone can't change the world. Nothing can be done by yourself..."
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "What's wrong with being content with the status quo? With you and these children, my life has been completed perfectly, and it's time to sit down and enjoy this quiet time."
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Since that time, there have been few opportunities to draw a knife. Huh? I am not sorry, but happy. To spend every day peacefully-that's why it was built. And now, It has completed its mission. So ~ I am happy."
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Some idiot said he wants to raise some small animals, I bet you, this matter will be gone in the end~"
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Oh oh... you are a little too serious, what time is it now, your biological clock has not yet protested? Well, you should go to rest, I will take over the rest of the work. Good night~ "
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "That Mr. Sakamoto is the most famous disciple in the genre of swordsmanship that a certain idiot has learned. But it is not swordsmanship that makes him famous, but the way of doing business. A person's life is always full of all kinds of things. Dramatic element~"
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_1:0 "These old equipment...when are they the heads?"
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_2:0 "If you equip me with new weapons, then I will be able to perform better! Lord Admiral, how about this proposal?"
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_3:0 "It's not that the 533mm torpedo is not good... but the sour torpedo looks shiny..."
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_4:0 "With my knowledge, even if it is transferred to a training ship, it will not be a problem."
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_5:0 "Are you on duty at night? A trivial matter. Please rest assured."
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_6:0 "Really a pediatrics job. Admiral, you are also very hard."
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Anyway, there is no mission, so let me lie here to enjoy the sun~ Ah... the sun is so warm, I really want to sleep-Zzzzz..."
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Um...what are you going to do? Is it time for lunch? No...Time flies really slowly, I feel like I've been sleeping all day, it's really boring..."
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Just lie down without doing anything. I'm afraid I will get rusty like these torpedoes, and then be thrown into the warehouse~ Ah, it's really scary and scary. Does this really happen? I was just now. Guessing."
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It's better to get rid of the fatigue, but chess and card games are better, but after all, no one has been able to beat me for a long time, whether it's flower cards, mahjong, or shogi. Do you want to try it? Your opponent is you If you do, I won’t embarrass you to lose too much~"
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "She used to be a child who would be frightened by caterpillars, but now she has become so strong that even the eldest sister dares to scold her... Although it is not a bad thing, it is always a little awkward. It is the one who will cry in my arms. She is a little cuter~"
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Being a transport ship is better than stopping in the port area and doing nothing~ If this goes on, my heart will get rusty first. Admiral, you will not let me go out of the port on purpose? You want to take this Occupy me~ Just kidding, eh? Are you serious?! eh eh eh?!!!"
 oui_TouchDialog_1:0 "Sister, she always thinks about new equipment, and I agree with her on this point. Admiral, are you in no trouble?"
 oui_TouchDialog_2:0 "Our performance is beyond doubt. Standing in front of you is the best example."
 oui_TouchDialog_3:0 "My name is the simplest in your port area. I will never make a fool of myself when scheduling."
 oui_TouchDialog_4:0 ""You cannot relax your vigilance even at night", this is the creed of the battlefield."
 oui_TouchDialog_5:0 "It's already time to rest, and the children of the destroyer should be enough."
  oui_TouchDialog_6:0 "I can do the job of the training ship. Of course, there are prerequisites. What do you think it will be?"
 oui_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Once a person relaxes, it will be difficult to return to the state of concentration. But if you keep your whole heart and soul in it, you will get tired..."
 oui_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I used to be very cowardly, I just wanted to stay behind my sisters and wait for things to pass. But my sister told me that if this goes on, I will only become a waste of relying on others... I can't let her look down on Me, so, I must change. Then, I did it."
 oui_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I just mentioned it casually. I didn't expect the prototype to be completed so soon... Well, the opportunity for the change is pinned on this device. I believe you, Doctor."
 oui_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Some people probably have been blessed by the gods since they were born? For example, my sister, she has so good luck that she can still catch the moon every time she sits in the village for four consecutive games... This is beyond common sense, right? ..."
 oui_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The tactics that the child has developed, shouldn't it be her? There are some wild thoughts in his mind. This child, as long as he calms down, will surely become an excellent warship. However, it is not something I should worry about. NS."
 oui_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Admiral, I'm here to review your work. Um... it's much faster than expected. For your seriousness, these night snacks I made have a new owner~ Be careful~"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_1:0 "Etiquette is the foundation of being a person. Etiquette is essential no matter in daily life or in battle~Of course, I don’t know what will happen~"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_2:0 ""Old antique" or something, it hurts to say it. Your lord admiral, you must not say such things."
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_3:0 "Single-mounted cannon was the mainstream configuration in the past. Please call this a "recognized design"! Woo...If the inventor of Minato is there, she will definitely teach you a lesson!"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_4:0 "Regulate your work and rest time for yourself, and then execute it on time, and your body will naturally become better. So, good night, Admiral-ah! Don't grab my face!"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_5:0 "Hey, the destroyers over there, hurry back to the dormitory! Otherwise, Big Sister will come and spank you! Humph, Big Sister does what it says!"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_6:0 "You have to do your own things independently. This is also one of the basic etiquette. If you want others to help, please use honorifics~Hurry up~Speak and listen~"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "People have different personalities. Listening to the testimonials may turn into "sarcasm". For example, I hate the word "senior". I'm not that old yet!"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Well, these little ghosts... are chattering all day and not being honest for a moment. It would be nice if they were all quiet and reliable like Tao. Well, where did she go..."
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Those things in the magazine, I really want to buy... Can I just go to work? Well, if you can, I really don't want to show up..."
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Those little ghosts will get into the water once they get into trouble. It's really big...No, I don't want to get my clothes wet. Why don't you go out~ they will listen to you~"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Admiral, although I said not to think of me as an "old antique", don't treat people as a child! Let go! Don't grab my face! It hurts and hurts"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The bath water is ready for you~ Let your body relax before going to bed. No, the bathroom is too small to accommodate two people! Let go! Yeah ah ah -"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_1:0 "Even if it is a single-mounted cannon, the power improved by my hand cannot be underestimated! Let's experiment now!"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_2:0 "The way to get the most accurate experimental data, of course, is to use yourself as an experimental subject! Hey, this is the so-called practice is greater than theory!"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_3:0 "Just convert the main gun into a missile! That way, the attack efficiency will be doubled! Of course, you will provide all the cost of modification and the materials consumed~"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_4:0 "It is too inefficient to conduct inspections by people! Let this master develop a mechanical guard to liberate everyone! Huh? No research funding!?"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_5:0 "You can't be impatient during the experiment, you can make sure that you keep it safe. It's the same as the speed, the faster you run, the easier it is to capsize! Haha, are you serious?"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_6:0 "I like your look like this. But if you add somehey, don’t worry, I won’t use you as an experiment. Really~oh~"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Using oneself to do experiments is not something that every scientist can do. It's just that I'm not a scientist yet, because I haven't gotten results yet."
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "It is too inefficient to supplement the various elements needed by the body through food. For this reason, I specially extracted the trace elements needed every day to make capsules, and only one capsule can replace the daily diet. How is it? Do you want to try?"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Success is precisely the dangerous peak that accumulates on repeated failures to reach the top."
  Yuubari_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Don't hesitate, do what you think of, and you will know the consequences after the event happens."
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Sleeping" is also a redundant behavior. Regulating body functions is a simple thing that I developedI’m disappointed, that thing has not been developed yet. Huh? Why are you happy?"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "No matter how powerful the firepower is, if it can't hit the enemy, it's just a fancy. If the auxiliary aiming system is built into the weapon, this dilemma can be improved. As for that system, it is not possible yet~"
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_1:0 "Oh, sir! What's wrong, are you coming to the drill too? Ha, because you look eager to try."
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_2:0 "Encountered a storm at sea, then sailed to an unknown bay, docked in a mysterious port... Just thinking about it, it's already boiling!"
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_3:0 "Fighting is not a trifle, so don't be reserved."
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_4:0 "The sea breeze brings the smell of rust, is there something nearbyah, sir, why are you running to the beach so late?"
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_5:0 "I want to drink a bit... I remember the wine cellar is here"
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_6:0 "You are still dealing with these pieces of paper. When will the work be over? Haha, I don't understand. Don't think about asking me to help."
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Is the coastal port building fortifications? It keeps ringing all day and it is noisy! Hey! Where are these turrets going? What?! Shore defense guns!?"
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The "tactic" exists to avoid meaningless sacrifices. Obey orders and do everything possible to be considered a qualified fighter!"
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Cologne! Don't stick to the chief all day! Are you still a soldier like this? Huh? Let me let go! Who allowed you to hug the chief?!"
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "There is a clearing on the other side of the woods, where I grow a lot of potatoes. What? Anyway, it's empty, what's wrong with planting some vegetables!"
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The battleship is nothing great, but it is a harder armored target. No matter how strong the firepower is, it will be an iron can floating on the sea if it fails to hit a person!"
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I only have a sense of awe for the real strong. But don't want me to say flattery, those hypocritical words will instead dust the strong."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_1:0 "Coexisting peacefully, this is really a beautiful sight."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_2:0 "Participate in war and take the lead. This is a rule that everyone should abide by."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_3:0 "A rare break, what should I do? It's really annoying. I can't seem to find anything to be entertained except work."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_4:0 "Reefs are natural enemies of ships, especially at nights like this."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_5:0 "Because of this lighthouse, the dark night doesn't look so cold. The light in the darkness is so precious."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_6:0 "As long as it is work, I can help. Please rest assured to give orders, sir."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Using immature technology may lead to disastrous failures. Warriors are not ants, but residents of this world who are the same as you and me."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Everyone can tell the truth, how many people can really understand the meaning? But the less you know, the easier you can live, ha ha."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Precision calculations are the first step to success, and this also applies to the kitchen. A slight difference in one step may cause the entire dish to lose its original flavor. Cologne, here it is time to turn to a small fire"
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It is also very important to figure out where you are. Am I? I am your secretary and your partner."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Take a good rest, sir. Everyone will see what you have done for this port area. I will take over the next thing. Don't worry, I am your secretary."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh? This is not an Oscar. Why are you here, "Poker Face" might cry if you find out you are not there. Also, she has grown up. Time flies so fast."
 Koln_TouchDialog_1:0 "A new day~Today's chief is also extraordinarily handsome~"
 Koln_TouchDialog_2:0 "Let’s go out to sea together, sir~ Hey? Do you still have to work? When will it be over..."
 Koln_TouchDialog_3:0 "Miss Deutsche~Is the training finished? Hey, do you want to try the dim sum I made? I can guarantee it will be delicious~"
 Koln_TouchDialog_4:0 "Exciting night! Romantic candlelight dinner! Obviously you can do a lot...Why do you need to be on duty!"
 Koln_TouchDialog_5:0 "Ah, it's really boring. Anything is good, something interesting will happen soon. For example, aliens or something--"
 Koln_TouchDialog_6:0 "Do you want me to help with the files? Okay! As long as I can stay with the sir, I am willing to do anything!"
  Koln_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "After the vow, of course, I am going to honeymoon...eh?! Is there no such option? How could this happen! This is completely different from the book!"
 Koln_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Cologne feels very disappointed... It feels like a good chocolate, but it turns out to be an imitation of peanuts!"
 Koln_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Love is not something to talk about, it's more like a lie! If you really love someone, you have to express it with action, like this-hey! The chief is caught!"
 Koln_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Potatoes are a very powerful food! As long as the idea is advanced enough, you can use it to make all kinds of novel dishes! Hey...Don't hold my hand! Let go of my sister!"
 Koln_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Sir~ I've been waiting! Cologne made a supper for you! Guess what it is? Hey...Guess it! Let Cologne say it directly, it won't be a bit of sentiment!"
 Koln_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Oh, sir, do you want to rest? Let Cologne help you make the bed! Don't worry! Cologne is very good at this! Even the always mean eldest sister praised me!"
 Sirius_TouchDialog_1:0 "Where is the commander going? Please take Sirius... I, I need to protect the commander at all times."
 Sirius_TouchDialog_2:0 "Senior Lin Xian, please...Senior please launch an attack together to train me!"
 Sirius_TouchDialog_3:0 "Ah... Commander, don't care about the injuries on your body, it's just that you accidentally trained with Senior Nelson..."
 Sirius_TouchDialog_4:0 "Pointing to... Commander, please don't leave me at night. If I can't see you, I...I can't protect you well."
 Sirius_TouchDialog_5:0 "Skerley Bay, really a nostalgic place."
 Sirius_TouchDialog_6:0 "Dawn...Oh, no, Senior Chongqing, I actually saw you here again...Yes, I once again have someone I hope to protect, and so do you seem."
 Sirius_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Looking at your expression, is that... have you had a nightmare? Come on, wipe your sweat, I will be by your side, don't worry."
 Sirius_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "(Stare) Hmm-will these things be difficult? Can a clumsy person like me learn it well?... Would you like to take the time to teach me?... Some happy... Really, really happy..."
 Sirius_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "There is a place near me that I have always wanted to go to, ehprobably similar to an amusement park?...I always wanted to go, but if you are alone...whyI will feel at ease with you."
 Sirius_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Can I compare you to summer... (blushing) Ah, nothing, I didn't say anything..."
 Sirius_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It's a bit cold at night, let me get you a coat... Don't catch the cold... Don't worry, I'm not sleepy. Just stay with you. When I come back, it will be soon."
 Sirius_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I don't know why, no matter what happens, as long as I can hold your hand, I feel very relieved...Thank you, it is really sweet."
 Arethusa_TouchDialog_1:0 "This level of training is really easy for me from an Orion background."
 Arethusa_TouchDialog_2:0 "Nelson went fox hunting again? Hey, really... why didn't you call me..."
 Arethusa_TouchDialog_3:0 "Ah...ah, I was defeated again. Damn it, I want to have the result of the Aurora Goddess too!"
 Arethusa_TouchDialog_4:0 "The stone thrower action...well, what a bad memory."
 Arethusa_TouchDialog_5:0 "Although Alphas's approach is undesirable, it must be said that it is an infatuated god..."
 Arethusa_TouchDialog_6:0 "Is the commander watching the moon? Although the moonlight is fascinating, it's really not in case compared to the moon god itself..."
 Arethusa_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "How about going hunting together? Don't live up to such a good weather...just, treat it as a date, OK?"
 Arethusa_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Spread the anti-mosquito potion on your body, and then trouble the commander to go and place traps there, like this... and then this... oh-well, it's easy, you try too, after placing it, We are about to wait for the stupid enemy to take the bait."
 Arethusa_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "No results have been achieved on the battlefield, hunting is impossible and nothing, commander, please rest assured, mine will definitely catch the prey... Otherwise, otherwise I won't go back!"
 Arethusa_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Should I not make any weird oaths? It's fine now, the sky is so dark, and I haven't caught any prey... My life is really hard... Commander, I'm sorry, I lost , I shouldn't be brave..."
 Arethusa_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Can you feel the power of the moonlight? The gentle moonlight in the legend can heal the wounds of people's hearts and clear away people's fatigue... Then, please relax and let me help you eliminate the fatigue of the day~"
 Arethusa_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Even if it is a major crisis, I can escape and avoid death. This is also a lucky one? Commander, what do you think?... Of course, meeting you is also lucky to be with this and this. I am really lucky to look at it this way."
 Galatea_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hmm... did you see clearly? Are you sure you remembered it? Really-I am Galatea, don't treat me as an enemy..."
 Galatea_TouchDialog_2:0 "Training, training begins!...Ah, why everyone’s firepower is so fierce, isn’t it just training! Ah-"
 Galatea_TouchDialog_3:0 "Silver Fairy...The fairy in the forest...I feel that everyone is so amazing, but I don't seem to have any big effect..."
 Galatea_TouchDialog_4:0 "The sea must be guarded! It must be..."
  Galatea_TouchDialog_5:0 "Why so many people like to walk by the sea at night? Is it a trend in this era? Um... I thought it was just that I like to watch the sea quietly by myself. How can it be quiet..."
 Galatea_TouchDialog_6:0 "Penelope's bunny hairpin is really-too ​​cute! Commander, would I be so cute if I wear it?"
 Galatea_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "(Dreamingly) Don't, don't come over, don't hit me...ooh...it hurts..."
 Galatea_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ah-Commander, you just came! Bi, Bismarck is terrible! Save me! Don't, don't chase me... Hey? I lost my wallet? Really... So... You are not a badass... "
 Galatea_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Peneloplatin is great for keeping calm all the time. When can I do this..."
 Galatea_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I was injured by the patrol as an enemy again... It hurts... Commander, do I really look like an enemy?... Then you say, why on earth do they do it indiscriminately... I don't want to Counterattack, can only be beaten silently..."
 Galatea_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, you won't admit me wrong, do you? Are you?...Haha, it's just a little worried, you won't admit me wrong!"
 Galatea_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Secretly looking for Peneloplatin for the rabbit headdress, let me put it on and have a look...Also...it's cute? Would you like to show it to the commander?"
 Penelope_TouchDialog_1:0 "Training? Wait a while, I'll take a break... Don't worry, it's just a short while without delay."
 Penelope_TouchDialog_2:0 "Ah... the fighting is really annoying, but occasionally it also reveals its interesting side."
 Penelope_TouchDialog_3:0 "Oh...failed again! Hey, commander, why are you looking at me with such a mocking look, or else you try?"
 Penelope_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, there is something to do in a while. I have newly researched a dish and it will be ready immediately. Would you like to try it?"
 Penelope_TouchDialog_5:0 "Tomorrow, start working hard tomorrow, I won't be late...probably."
 Penelope_TouchDialog_6:0 "Diva, you really helped me a lot! Phew, my clothes are riddled with tears every time I fight. I'm really annoying.... I'm not as smart as you!"
 Penelope_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Huh? So you didn't just talk casually, but serious?...I didn't realize it, then it's time to fulfill the responsibilities of being a partner and go cook."
 Penelope_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Why are there so many armaments in the port area during this time? It is not lost, and it will soon be useless if you don't lose it... Really, it is a headache to deal with so many resources... Just build a large warehouse, how about it? commander?"
 Penelope_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "My sisters have outstanding personalities... Me? Commander, you have been with me for so long, and you still don't understand my personality. What an incompetent partner."
 Penelope_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Compared to a ring, a true heart is more important than anything. It is not the diamond ring that touches me. For me, diamond rings are very common, but you only have one...hey? Why are you blushing? I said Is there something wrong?"
 Penelope_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, for the sake of success in future operations, I suggest that in large-scale warfare, I recommend that Miss Hood be on duty every afternoon and sign in according to the names on this list... By the way, don't forget to change the coffee to cold coffee."
 Penelope_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I really envy those who can express their inner feelings with songs, paintings, and words...I can't do these things, and you don't have to expect too much. Of course there is one thing I can do. (Kiss)"
 Aurora_TouchDialog_1:0 "Training hard, I must become a fearful presence on the battlefield!"
 Aurora_TouchDialog_2:0 "My sisters are all very good people, it's all my luck that I have such credit."
 Aurora_TouchDialog_3:0 "As long as the loyalty to faith is not obliterated in the heart, the glory of the Royal Navy will last forever."
 Aurora_TouchDialog_4:0 "Silver Goblin, it's a good title to think about it. With me, the enemy will have nowhere to escape."
 Aurora_TouchDialog_5:0 "Since I was a child, I have admired the heroic fighting attitude of the predecessors, especially the encirclement and suppression of Bismarck, it is really exciting."
 Aurora_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, if you are tired, let me do the rest of the work."
 Aurora_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Commander, did you just get up? Hey, I finally finished the mission, I'm exhausted... Whoa, what silver goblin, the mission is all at night, I don’t have a chance to stay with you. happy……"
 Aurora_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Because I have a task at night, I was granted a rest during the day. However, it is more reassuring to stay by your side after thinking about it... Hee hee, if I am sleepy, I will sleep on your body~"
 Aurora_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Incarnate as a white light and rush into the enemy's formation... Hee hee, I don't know who described me that way, but it's still pretty handsome, isn't it?... How would you describe me fighting, Commander?"
 Aurora_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Ah-it's all at this point, the commander should have rested, and the lights have gone out, then I will lightly...ah! Commander, you scared me, really, not serious !"
 Aurora_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Looking at your frown, you must tell me anything that is uncomfortable. After all, I am the goddess of dawn, representing hope and light, and you will be happy if you tell me about it!"
 Aurora_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Oh, it's time to go, hehe, the commander must have a good rest, good night (kiss)."
 Omaha_TouchDialog_1:0 "During combat, it is often affected by the wind and waves on the sea...It is really unpleasant."
 Omaha_TouchDialog_2:0 "Although everyone is an excellent ship girl, there are only a few with rich combat experience like me~"
 Omaha_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey, Commander, do you want to patrol with me?"
 Omaha_TouchDialog_4:0 "Every time I come back from the patrol, I can see the commander at work. It's really hard~"
 Omaha_TouchDialog_5:0 "The so-called neutral patrol is actually a kind of tactics~"
 Omaha_TouchDialog_6:0 "I hope I can fight with Senior Saratoga once..."
  Omaha_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "It is enough for me to patrol the port area, so you can sleep well, your body comes first!"
 Omaha_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Nevada and they are drinking beer every day, is it really so good?...Would you like to taste it...No, I can't..."
 Omaha_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The sun is shining! It's okay to be lazy occasionally, hehe, do you want to bask in the sun with me?"
 Omaha_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "A wealth of experience tells me that no one will come to this place at this time, so this is the place for the next appointment with the commander."
 Omaha_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The feasting at night is the easiest to corrupt people's hearts, Commander, you must be able to resist the temptation!"
 Omaha_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Hee hee, as the first member who came to your port area, I already know where and when you will go~ So, no matter when, we can meet by chance!"
 Atlanta_TouchDialog_1:0 "(Dididi~) Hey, Commander... Atlanta is not lazy, just doing necessary training~"
 Atlanta_TouchDialog_2:0 "Enemies in the air, let me strike them down and show them to you!"
 Atlanta_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey~ Commander, is there anything for me to do today?"
 Atlanta_TouchDialog_4:0 "Is the commander tired? Let Atlanta do the rest for you."
 Atlanta_TouchDialog_5:0 "The shelling should be aimed like this...ah, Commander, you didn't see anything, did you?"
 Atlanta_TouchDialog_6:0 "Juneo is always duplicity, I really want to know what she is thinking~"
 Atlanta_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Training is not only to enhance combat ability, but also... wait, don't talk, I seem to hear what your heart is saying, the noise is so loud...inaudible... let me get closer... hey? Is the noise bigger?"
 Atlanta_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Huh-so tired, Commander, did you prepare drinks for Atlanta? Atlanta wants to drink Coke! It's iced!"
 Atlanta_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It is important to be able to listen to the voices of others, because people tend to have different opinions when they are angry and flustered, and they do radical things. If they can understand their feelings, they will not cause misunderstandings."
 Atlanta_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Atlanta senses that you are tired now. Is it tea? Or massage? Or... knee pillow?"
 Atlanta_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The night is very quiet. It is a good opportunity for me to practice listening to others!...Ah! Who is playing the song! Headache! Alaska, stop!"
 Atlanta_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Commander, commander, commander~ hee hee, the heartbeat is getting faster and faster, is it being teased by Atlanta?"
 Juneau_TouchDialog_1:0 "Atlanta is big and small!...Hey, San Francisco, don't let it go...Although it's just a drill, you still have to put up a lot of energy."
 Juneau_TouchDialog_2:0 "If you are in danger...huh! I don't expect rescue, I can get out of the situation by myself."
 Juneau_TouchDialog_3:0 "Sisters fighting together, it really makes people feel passionate!"
 Juneau_TouchDialog_4:0 "Why is it so slow to process files? Forget it, let me divide the files. I want to go back to rest early."
 Juneau_TouchDialog_5:0 "The radar for sending and receiving information must be kept unblocked, otherwise it would be bad if you can’t send out information in danger..."
 Juneau_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sullivan...hehe, she's really cute, Commander, don't let her get hurt! Otherwise, I won't let you go."
 Juneau_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Commander!! Don't be so constrained when assigning battles, as long as you allocate your combat power, we will leave the rest to us... Don’t forget, the ring you gave me is a proof of trust in me, dare If you doubt my strength... hum, you will feel better!"
 Juneau_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Commander, you give me a hurry up! Don't sleep too late! Five minutes less sleep will not kill you! Go brush your teeth! Then try the breakfast I made! Then give me a good comment, listen Are we there?"
 Juneau_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Obviously today is my time to show my skills, why the stupid Commander hasn't come yet! Humph  dare to be late on such an important day! There is no way, I can only hold on until the commander is here, and I must let you See the most exciting moment!"
 Juneau_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "You should be fortunate that you met me, which saved you a lot of hesitation. How about? Would you like to thank this lady? If you are thankful, this lady has something for you! You...what are you doing? The face doesn't matter, this lady made this by herself...Ah, I said it...I think I didn't hear it!"
 Juneau_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Sullivan! Come here!...Ah, don’t linger, this is a gift from the commander...how do I know why I want to give it to you, and I don’t know why I want to give it to you, anyway, I didn’t give it to you. Gift, are you moved? Would you like to take it apart and take a look?"
 Juneau_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh-I'm so tired, come and rub my shoulders!...Ah, it's comfortable, it's so comfortable...I can consider making something delicious for you when my lady is well rested~!"
 Brooklyn_TouchDialog_1:0 "In any respect, Helena and St. Louis are both excellent sisters~"
 Brooklyn_TouchDialog_2:0 "As long as the rate of fire can continue to increase, you can seize the opportunity in battle."
 Brooklyn_TouchDialog_3:0 "When fighting, please let me be the pioneer, and I will bring you the most perfect victory."
 Brooklyn_TouchDialog_4:0 "Although they are sisters, Helena and St. Louis seem to seldom talk with our other sisters."
 Brooklyn_TouchDialog_5:0 "These words are really dizzying, or leave it to the commander to do it..."
  Brooklyn_TouchDialog_6:0 "Oh~ Has the commander finally had a chance to come out to hang out at night? Hurry up, I just cooked a fish, do you want to come and eat it together?"
 Brooklyn_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "How about going to the beach and sunbathing together?... Remember to bring sunscreen, by the way... Do you know how to put sunscreen on someone?"
 Brooklyn_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Why are they so rigid in Washington, Commander, you shouldn't be able to look at it stubbornly... What is "for freedom and justice". It's annoying to emphasize every day... Now there is no one around, and the curtains are closed. I teach you to dance?"
 Brooklyn_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Huh-it's really comfortable to get out of the sun, Commander, come on, too, stretch yourself under the sun... Ah-so comfortable!"
 Brooklyn_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Have you learned the dance during the day? It's okay now anyway, how about revisiting it again?"
 Brooklyn_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Don't pay too much attention to rules and the like. Is the love between you and me determined by rules?... So, this thing can't even be given to us by love. What do you do if you follow this thing?"
 Brooklyn_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Although alcoholism is prohibited in the port area, I didn't say that you can't have a drink. Come with me for a drink, okay~"
 Helena_TouchDialog_1:0 "Strategic transfer and fleeing are very different! If you don't seize the opportunity, it may lead to tragedy."
 Helena_TouchDialog_2:0 "Temporary command? It shouldn't be a big problem if you hand it over to me."
 Helena_TouchDialog_3:0 "It is never wrong to proceed with caution."
 Helena_TouchDialog_4:0 "If you find an enemy at night, you must give priority to your teammates."
 Helena_TouchDialog_5:0 "Although we are both Brooklyn-class, there is still a big difference between me and St. Louis and my sisters."
 Helena_TouchDialog_6:0 "Is the commander's job finished? Helena is still patrolling and can't accompany you, sorry."
 Helena_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I still feel a little uncomfortable, and suddenly I have a deeper bond with you. It's like a fairy tale story."
 Helena_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Huh, it's a little chest tight when the weather is hot...Ah, don't look at me with that strange look...In this case, it will be very troublesome to be seen!"
 Helena_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "If I have the opportunity, I would like to try other clothes..."
 Helena_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Huh, it is always disturbing at night. Commander, please don't run around!"
 Helena_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Are you going to accompany me... at night? This is a very tiring job, so don't complain about it!"
 Helena_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Although...Although our relationship is already very close, if you look at me like this..."
 NingHai_TouchDialog_1:0 "Woo...what exactly does it take to make Pinghai and the others stronger?"
 NingHai_TouchDialog_2:0 "The training mode of each country is different. It seems that you have to study hard."
 NingHai_TouchDialog_3:0 "I will use my power to make the harbor stronger!"
 NingHai_TouchDialog_4:0 "Although NingHai is only a foreign ship, he still likes this country and this place."
 NingHai_TouchDialog_5:0 "Admiral, Ning Hai has cooked a dish, would you like to try it?"
 NingHai_TouchDialog_6:0 "Obviously it is a light cruiser, I also really want to be able to continue to grow!"
 NingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Admiral, what do you like to eat?... What do you dislike?... Well, well, I wrote it down, but for your health, I may put your favorite and dislike dishes together. ~!"
 NingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Although I have been studying abroad for many years, I have never forgotten my own engraving... But thanks to that time, I also mastered the languages ​​and eating habits of various countries, so I can do whatever you want to eat. Do it!"
 NingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Do you remember? When I first arrived in the port area, it seemed that there were not so many people at that time. I didn't expect it to be so strong now..."
 NingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Admiral, a reasonable schedule can make your work more efficient. Don't be too late. I warmed a glass of milk and drink it while it is hot."
 NingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It's still not good enough, but I have learned so much training experience, I must find a way to provide you with more help..."
 NingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Hee hee, although I'm usually a fool, but when I get to work, I still have a serious and handsome side..."
 PingHai_TouchDialog_1:0 "Today is another day! The admiral wants to come on! Come on~! Come on!"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_2:0 "Admiral, that... can you take me to see the training of sisters from other countries... Please~!"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_3:0 "Pinghai is a battleship independently developed by country C! Be independent! This is amazing!"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_4:0 "Wow! Admiral, this, this...this is a training plan given to me by sister Ning Hai, I want to secretly work hard..."
 PingHai_TouchDialog_5:0 "Ping Hai has never stole anything from the kitchen! Absolutely no~!"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_6:0 "How can I become stronger?"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey? Hey?! Admiral, can I really go in and out of this office? Wouldn't it be too good?... That's great! But Ping Hai is going to train now! See you later!"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I lost the exercise again. Although I know that I am weak, I am not reconciled...Admiral, I...I want to be stronger! Can I?"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Huh? Admiral, you, why do you get up so early, Sister Yixian hasn't done it yet... Ah, I haven't cooked yet, can you sleep for a while? Soon!"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Drink! Ha! Huh-although it seems a bit difficult to fully grasp, but practicing like this every day should help strengthen your physique, hehe~"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Yes, I'm a little sleepy, Admiral, can Ping Hai take a rest by your side? Hey, don't forget to call me when you go back!"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Hmm-this dish is so difficult... that dish is also very complicated... which one to learn? Or find sister Yixian..."
 Roberts_TouchDialog_1:0 "Abbecronbi insists on running and exercising with a cannon every day...I'm really worried about her body."
 Roberts_TouchDialog_2:0 "Abbecronbi always carries the cannon on his back, it really feels so hard, actually...in fact, just sit on the cannon~"
 Roberts_TouchDialog_3:0 "Speed ​​is actually not important, what is important is firepower, as long as it hits the enemy~"
  Roberts_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, have you seen Abercrombie? She seems to have just gone out alone with a cannon on his back."
 Roberts_TouchDialog_5:0 "Everyone went on patrol at night, why was I the only one assigned the task of standing guard?"
 Roberts_TouchDialog_6:0 "Although the sisters of the destroyer admire my firepower, occasionally I also envy their flexibility..."
 Roberts_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Commander, do you want to go out together? Come on, let's sit on the cannon together... Although it's a bit slow, cannon, let's go!"
 Roberts_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Huh-huh-I, am I late? Yes, I'm sorry, I almost missed...Let me take a break, let's go play together again, good, so tired..."
 Roberts_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Even the slow-loading crossbow arrows, as long as they are loaded, are no less threatening than any weapon now...so, as long as I get time to the combat position in advance, I can play as much as any sister. Strength."
 Roberts_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Commander, commander, where are we going to play tonight?"
 Roberts_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The love secrets given by Miss London...It's really hard to understand..."
 Roberts_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "My current happiness is given to me by my seniors and you, how can I give back to everyone..."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_1:0 "Commander...whoop, morning, good morning, I, I continue to run..."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_2:0 "I make progress little by little, and we must not slack off..."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_3:0 "I don't know what kind of existence my sister and I are in the eyes of the commander? After all, they are not as powerful as the other sisters..."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_4:0 "My sister is really an optimist, I envy her..."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_5:0 "I think I am useless just because I am a shallow water heavy artillery? I don't think so, one day I will... let everyone see how powerful I am!"
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_6:0 "The commander hasn't rested yet? I just happened to be out for some evening physical training. Would you like to come and have a look?"
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Huh-huh-so tired, but...I, I can hold on...you, you don't need to help..."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Commander, would you like to do weight-bearing exercises with me? It is very helpful for your body! Or... you can sit on the cannon and I will walk with you on your back."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Today, today we are going to train...ahhhhh
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Just stay by your side... it shouldn't matter if you don't communicate with other people..."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Except for my sister, the best for me is you..."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "You also often sit there alone in a daze. Can I be with you? ... It's okay if you don't speak."
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_1:0 "Admiral, Admiral, Chuuxue has something fun~"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_2:0 "Fubuki is a special expulsion~ It is different from ordinary expulsion!"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey, admiral, do you want to sign a contract with Fubuki? Magichey☆"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_4:0 "Admiral, Fubuki has learned the magic of "hypnosis" recently! Would you like to try it~☆"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_5:0 "Shen Xue, keep your focus during the shelling, and don't look aroundHuh?! Admiral! Are you still asleep?!"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_6:0 "I really lost to the admiral... It's agreed, can't you tell other people?"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey~ The admiral is so close, do you want to get closer to Fubuki? It seems that the admiral has fallen into the magic of Fubuki's "love"~"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 ""As long as you use this magic, you can make the love between lovers eternal..." Hey~ It seems to be true~ How can there be this kind of magic, it must be mind control~"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Not only Fubuki, but I also hope that the admiral will also take care of the other sisters of the 11th Destroyer Team. We are the sisters who have walked together until now. If this love is only devoted to Fubuki, Fubuki will not feel happy. Yeah. Chuuxue is serious! Don't laugh!"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 ""♬The snow is falling, sending away the haze that ended. Haier is singing, welcoming the light of the rising sun♬"Hey, does it sound good? If the admiral likes it, Chuuxue can continue singing~"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Admiral, are you coming to observe the drill? Hey~ Fubuki's true strength, except for my sisters, you are the first to appreciate it~ Be happy to have such a wonderful partner~"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It would be great if the clerks could be solved with magic...Woo, it's really boring... Fubuki wants to go outside and breathe fresh air. In this case, I can only help the admiral to complete these things. Even if there is no magic, Fuxue is very strong!"
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_1:0 "My sister always comes back late recently, even if it's playing, there must be a limit..."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_2:0 "Is the admiral tired? If you don't mind, take a nap on my lap... Sorry, I said something strange. Please don't take it to heart."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_3:0 "Does the admiral like the older sister's type? Ah, yes, there is nothing wrong with being lively. But it should be somewhat like a sister..."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's really quiet in the port area at midnight. This voice... is it from the drill field? I'm still training so late..."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_5:0 "Please don't worry about me, because my sister and Shenxue always come back late, so even take me to sleep late."
  Shirayuki_TouchDialog_6:0 "There are so many things in the house. Even if I help out together, I still have to do it till now. I have worked hard, Admiral."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Is it lucky to live in such a world? To be able to meet everyone again, to know more friends, to be able to meet you. Perhaps it is because of you that I have me."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "When will my elder sister change back to who she used to be...Although the elder sister is still smiling, but her heart is already depressed. Admiral, can you think of a way? I, I... I want to make my sister again She herself, in that case, I too..."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Ah, Lord Admiral~ Newly baked dumplings, would you like to try some? As an afternoon tea pastime, paired with a cup of barley tea is really great. It’s all about having such a leisurely time. Your credit~"
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Admiral? Why did you come here... Is the work done? It seems to be the same, then let me show you around the factory. As a place for dating, it's really a bit What about shame... Ah, I'm just talking to myself, it's nothing."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Is this the coffee from the western side? Hmm...you can drink it by brewing it directly? It's a little different from Shirayuki's imagination. I don't know what it will taste like if it is dipped in yokan? Would you like to come together? Try it~Admiral Sir~"
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "You can't rest until you finish processing these files. You should be a bit conscious as the admiral~ Of course, I will accompany you. If you need snacks and tea, please feel free to let me know. As long as you can help Your busyness, no matter what kind of request you can ask."
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hey, the first time I met~ Oh, it turned out to be the admiral. Sorry~ I didn’t recognize it for a while~"
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_2:0 "Neck is a little sore...ah, it's okay, admiral, you don't need to worry~"
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_3:0 "Oh~ Senior! Admiral, do you think these seniors are very reliable?"
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_4:0 "Night long-distance running is also a good choice~ The challenge has just begun!"
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_5:0 "Stay up late is a big taboo for good health, but if this is work, there is nothing to do..."
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_6:0 "...Ah, I fell asleep inadvertently. Sorry, sorry~ the biological clock is not so easy to correct."
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 ""If you want to grab a person's heart, you must first grab his stomach. "Someone once said that~ Then, I want to eat steak at noon~ You will do it, right? Hey~"
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ah~ I'm exhausted, I'm exhausted~ Admiral-I want to drink salt soda~ Puff! It's refreshing~ After running, you still have to add salt~ Ah, Admiral, drink a little too, come on ~Ah"
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Admiral! Find a place for me to hide! The second sister looks very angry!...Are you going? Ah, scared to death~ It’s just a cake. . Speaking of it, what does it mean that "35" is written on the cake?...Woo! It's miserable!"
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Ask what kind of person I want to be? You are unexpectedly sentimental. Um...I want to be stronger. This way I can protect everyone. Haha, isn't it very boring to talk about? Everyone Everyone wants to be strong, everyone has different reasons. This is the "person"..."
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Good evening, Admiral. Are you still busy with work? Ah~ When can I have my own free time? Really, I can't stand it anymore! I'll help too! !"
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Woo... I was beaten as expected. The second sister is still the same, and she is very strict with her sister... Alas, admiral, when is your birthday-too ​​sudden? Don't be nervous, let's There shouldn’t be any reservations in between~Come on~tell me~"
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_1:0 "I always feel very at ease with my sister. This is the trait that my sister should have~ Hmm."
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_2:0 "No combat experience or something, it's not what I think..."
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_3:0 "The turret floats? It must be the admiral's illusion, it must be like this."
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_4:0 "Why are you on duty at night... What if you are late..."
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_5:0 "Wow wow wow wow! No...Don't touch people suddenly! Please stop the mischief..."
  Miyuki_TouchDialog_6:0 "(Whispering) Admiral Admiral? Hmm...Sleep confirmation. It should not be too late to rush over now, I hope my sister will not be angry..."
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "What's the matter? You've been staring at me since just now? I won't disappear suddenly, you don't need to be so nervous. But...thank you, apart from sisters, you are the first to care so much. My man. Really...what am I talking about..."
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "With you by my side, it seems that all difficulties can be easily solved. It feels like my sister...Although you and I are not related by blood, it is better than the relationship of flesh and blood-oo, I said something terrible..."
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Where did she go... If she is there, the "Eleventh Destroyer" can be reunited. Although everyone does not mention this matter, they are all very concerned about her. The family really cares about her. It’s better to be together, just like you and mewhy! I can’t speak out anymore!"
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It’s also a talent to be able to say what you think straightforwardly...but it always feels like it’s not something to be bragged about, but sometimes it can be embarrassing...Ah! Admiral, it’s you...it shocked me ..."
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I envy my sister who can cook so many dishes, even the heartless sister Chuxue who can cook basic dishes... Why can't I just take the ingredients? Oh... if I can let the admiral. How good would it be to eat the dishes you made yourself..."
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "In the summer, you can have a test contest! I haven't lost it once! This is not bragging! Otherwise, the admiral will be with me next time! I will bring it beautifully. It’s for you to win!"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_1:0 "Because I am an older sister, you can trust me with confidence!"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_2:0 "I miss my partner in the 10th Destroyer a little bit..."
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_3:0 "Sisters are very afraid of the dark, admiral, don't let her be on duty at night by herself."
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_4:0 "Everything hidden in the dark can't escape the eyes of my lord!"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_5:0 "The searchlight is a prop prepared for the moment! No matter how dark it is, don’t be afraid!"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_6:0 "I don't know if the sisters are asleep... I'm a little worried... When will the duty last?"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I should really praise your vision. After so many people have chosen this lord, hum! As the first ship of the Special Type III destroyer, this lord is undoubtedly the most sophisticated! Do you still need to praise you more? As long as you want, hum~"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The first ray of sunlight at dawn, although it is a bit chilly, but my heart is very warm. Okay! Let's plan today's schedule! Well-I decided to use it to supervise your work today! Don't be lazy Oh~"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Oh! The one over there is-Hai, Helena! Admiral! Help me stop! Um...Is she gone? Ah... It's a risk. She accidentally drank her and put her on the bench. If you get caught  wow wow wow! Helena!? Don’t pinch my face! I know it’s wrong!!"

 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh... Dumplings... Mochi... Puddings-Huh! No, haven't you been spotted?! Huh, it looks like nobody is here... It's so good~ It's not easy to keep your image~"
 Hibiki_TouchDialog_1:0 "The "phoenix" or something, I don't need..."
 Hibiki_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sisters are so amazing... Only me..."
 Hibiki_TouchDialog_3:0 "I really don't like fighting..."
 Hibiki_TouchDialog_4:0 "The night... makes it difficult to follow..."
 Hibiki_TouchDialog_5:0 "Are you still awake? Don't leave me alone..."
 Hibiki_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sister?! Is this for me? Thank you! Do you want to eat with the admiral?"
 Hibiki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Yes...I will work hard. For sisters...for everyone...for you..."
 Hibiki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I want to grow, and I want to be a trustworthy person. Is it possible for me like this? With you here...I...maybe...no, I can do it."
 Hibiki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I...I am a "phoenix". I continue to experience trials and continue to be reborn from trials. Such a life... is me. It is decided, the future goal -"
 Hibiki_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Sister...how come here again, I can already be alone...no, not alone. The admiral is also with me."
 Hibiki_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I don't know how much growth can be achieved... But, for you, for this port area... I will do my best. Even now, I am a "phoenix"."
 Hibiki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It's late at night, it's time to rest. Today's work is also perfectly completed... Well, it's all your credit. Go to sleep. Good night, Admiral."
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_1:0 "The submarine’s torpedoes are always hard to avoid..."
  Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_2:0 "My sister is always reckless... although I didn't say that she was qualified."
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_3:0 "Keep your distance and keep your distance! Don't keep getting closer!"
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_4:0 "My sister must not be able to sleep, because I am not by her side! What a clingy sister~"
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_5:0 "The port area at night is quieter than expected... after all, it's time for rest."
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_6:0 "I always feel that there is someone on the exercise field... It's probably my illusion that it's so late?"
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I didn't expect your strength to be quite strong, it is really impressive! But you are still far from catching up with me, so don't get too proud of it!"
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "What's the matter? You are... uhh!
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Ha... I'm exhausted, is it a little yellow chicken? Ah, but everyone is equal, and there is nothing to care about. Hey, admiral, can you come and rub my shoulders for me? Thank you. ~What? Can't I say thank you? You are really weird."
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Sister~ Hmm, I came here as agreed. Here, the agreed gift~ Although it's a bit rough, I made it by myself! If you like it, let's go to the port area together~"
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "La la la ~ admiral, good evening~ ahem, are you coming to me? If it is a sincere request, I will not refuse it-of course I will do it after I have listened to your request Decided, isn’t this very reasonable."
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Um...Sisters of the special type I must be doing training? That's great~ If I can also become stronger, I will be able to impress my sister. Ah, admiral, did you hear me? I Do you want to join them too? It's really a headache..."
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_1:0 "It is not difficult to extend a helping hand to others~"
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_2:0 "I am the youngest one among the special destroyers... I want to have a younger sister too..."
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_3:0 "0"
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_4:0 "I still need to be on duty at night...Who actually came up with the punishment game..."
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_5:0 "Admiral, why don't you let me handle the paperwork? You go to patrol the port area, right?"
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sister, what is she doing? She must not be asleep yet, because I am not by her side."
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The sea breeze feels good. It's warm and refreshing, it's nice~"
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Which... would it be too intimate to hold hands directly? After all, it's still working hours, so you have to pay attention to it... eh... is that so? Then... just do what you mean... I... pour I don't care much..."
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I really want to wear a beautiful suit... Ah, when did you come here? Did you hear what I said to myself just now? Ah... But it’s true. I want to wear beautiful clothes, Girls are like this..."
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Stay up late is very damaging to the skin... Oh, I really want to end it soon. Admiral, bad-hearted..."
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "No, I'm not afraid of the dark. The point is not this. It's just that I don't want to be alone in the dark. So, can you stay with me? Until dawn"
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Well...Let's just stay together, it's nice. Thank you for your gift. My favorite sister, my sister only belongs to me..."
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_1:0 "I will not be afraid of hardship."
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_2:0 "Next, what do I need to do?"
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_3:0 "My sister is always very inexistent..."
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_4:0 "Go out? Go out! Now is the perfect time!"
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_5:0 "Am I being too noisy? Sorry... I'm so excited at night, if I can attack--"
  Ayanami_TouchDialog_6:0 "Is that my sister? Are you there? Huh? It's probably an illusion, she should be asleep."
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ah, are you here? What can I do? If it is an attack, please take me directly to the port. Huh?"
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Sister? I was with me just now, and now... I don't know where I am going. If I have a special task, I will be able to do it."
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Is it rustic? There is nothing wrong with it. Because the attire is not conspicuous, can't it be an advantage when attacking the enemy? Ah? You want to give me new clothes? No... it is not necessary... "
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It feels like the whole person is burning! The night is a great stage! Come on, unconscionable enemy! It hurts! Why is it suddenly knocking on my headShibo, has it bothered you? Sorry... I was too excited again."
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Use gunfire to vent the emotions in your heart! Hahaha...Ahem, Admiral? You are here. You have done something stupid, don't take it to heart. I will sort this out..."
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Um... hot cocoa, as if it melted... really, really terrible drink! Yes! Please give me another drink! I have to overcome this "fear"!"
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_1:0 "Please don't care about me... this is good."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sighing can not change anything, I have to cheer up."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_3:0 "Come on... Come on..."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_4:0 "No, I don't care. It doesn't matter if you are on duty at night..."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_5:0 "If I can join my sisters and their training...Admiral? Didn't you hear anything?"
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_6:0 "You can't half-hearted when you are on duty. Admiral, this sentence is also for you."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Don't mind, I will leave soon. Ah, is it me that you are looking for? Then...is there anything?"
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Sister, over there-eh? Is it looking for me? Why... Me, is there anything worthy of your attention?"
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It must be a mistake... Why did I get this ring? I...I'm just an inconspicuous little character...Why...Why..."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I can feel that I am shaking... Keep coming, you have been watching me. I...really, thank you very much! I... will do my best to be with you."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I like you. I like you watching me. This feeling is undoubtedly the most real. This heart is "dancing" with excitement."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Good night. Tomorrow, it will be better. Because with you, everything is so beautiful."
 Z1_TouchDialog_1:0 "Grow up a little bit~Someday I can become a great adult~"
 Z1_TouchDialog_2:0 "Practice seriously! I can definitely be the chief's helper!"
 Z1_TouchDialog_3:0 "Wow! Sir! Watch out for the mine ahead!"
  Z1_TouchDialog_4:0 "It is too dangerous to arrange mines at night and night! In case you can't see clearly..."
 Z1_TouchDialog_5:0 "Play hide-and-seek with friends from the Z series, but I still haven't found Z17 and Z18..."
 Z1_TouchDialog_6:0 "I'm sleepy...Is the sir's busy yet? Really, too, it's been a lot of hard work...Uh...whoop..."
 Z1_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sir...Can you help me? It seems...I can't find the training ground..."
 Z1_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hey, is the battle like this? It's a bit scary, but I'm my sister, I can't hold back..."
 Z1_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Do you like sweet ones? I have two candies here, one for you..."
 Z1_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Although I am a sister, I feel...Z16 is much more mature than me..."
 Z1_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hippel just gave me a glass of sparkling water with black bubbles. It's bitter..."
 Z1_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Sir, how can I be a good example for my sisters... It always feels so difficult, I don't know what to do..."
 Z16_TouchDialog_1:0 "Sister Z1 works so hard every day, and I can't fall behind!"
 Z16_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sir, arranging mines is also a very important job, don't underestimate it!"
 Z16_TouchDialog_3:0 "Train well during the day so that you can sleep well at night."
 Z16_TouchDialog_4:0 "I, I will definitely grow up sooner! This will...hehe, nothing more!"
 Z16_TouchDialog_5:0 "It is very hard to arrange mines with sister Z1 every day, but it is also a very happy thing!"
 Z16_TouchDialog_6:0 "Woo... I'm a little tired, and sure enough, my battery life is still too weak..."
 Z16_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sir, Z16 has completed today's training mission in advance, so that it can come to help you work."
 Z16_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Although Z16 is still not very good at taking care of others, I will definitely work hard to learn from other sisters in the port area, and I will definitely become a qualified...qualified...this word, I am a little embarrassed to say it..."
 Z16_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Although the combat is not as good as others, I can rely on precise mine-laying to knock down the enemy! This is my unique stunt! Is it awesome?"
 Z16_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Sir, today Deutsche taught me how to drink a drink, and said you will like it. First, find 1 catty of barley malt, 5 catties of water, 1-2 egg whites...Ah, why is your face not so good? ?"
 Z16_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Sir, can I be the power to protect you in the future?...Is it already? Or... I know, I will continue to work hard, hehe."
 Z16_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Just put some candy in the book, and you will have the motivation to open the book every day!"
 Z21_TouchDialog_1:0 "Um...sir, what do you want me to do?"
 Z21_TouchDialog_2:0 "I wish I could help the sir more."
 Z21_TouchDialog_3:0 "Actually, sometimes I still envy other friends of the Z series. Especially Z31..."
 Z21_TouchDialog_4:0 "Need, do you need my help? Great, sir, I will work hard!"
 Z21_TouchDialog_5:0 "If you can do more things to let everyone remember me..."
 Z21_TouchDialog_6:0 "Z31 is so strong, everyone must like her very much..."
 Z21_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sir, where are we going today? Should we go to the park or... the beach?"
 Z21_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hood and Rodney...not to be ignored...Although they look gentle, they are terrifying to get angry..."
 Z21_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I will go on a mission with my sisters Z17 and Z18...it shouldn't be too long... dinner... leave it to me!"
 Z21_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I'm content with you. Hey...Is it a little bit of a petty?"
 Z21_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Work is over? Let's... go for a walk? If you are too tired... forget it."
  Z21_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Wine? I can't drink this kind of thing... definitely not..."
 Z22_TouchDialog_1:0 "Forgive me for not knowing what to say, just leave things to me."
 Z22_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sir, what do you have to do today? You can leave it to me without worry."
 Z22_TouchDialog_3:0 "Actually, sometimes I am a little jealous of other friends of the Z series. Especially Z1 and Z16..."
 Z22_TouchDialog_4:0 "Need help? It seems that the sir still needs me very much."
 Z22_TouchDialog_5:0 "I will let everyone remember my name!"
 Z22_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sister Z1, as a flagship, can lead everyone to be very handsome! Sir, do you think so too."
 Z22_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sir, the weather is good today. Let's go to the beach and sunbathe together, or... go sit in the park?"
 Z22_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "That is...brave...sir, let's go around! I, I don't want to see her!"
 Z22_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The mine-laying operation is ready to begin! Today, I have to take a lot of detours, remember to make a meal and wait for me to come back to eat together! You are not allowed to eat alone~!"
 Z22_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Time flies so fast, I don’t know if it’s because of being with you~"
 Z22_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Work is over? Then go for a walk and get some breath. It's good for your health."
 Z22_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I really want to try the alcoholic beverages that the seniors like, but it's still too young. I'll be in a few years..."
 Z24_TouchDialog_1:0 "I had a dream last night. I dreamed that I was playing happily with the sir. Later... I can't remember clearly, I slept and remembered (lie)."
 Z24_TouchDialog_2:0 "Germany is really a kind big sister."
 Z24_TouchDialog_3:0 "Even if it is a single-mounted main gun, the power cannot be underestimated...probably."
 Z24_TouchDialog_4:0 "I really hope that every day has 24 hours of night..."
 Z24_TouchDialog_5:0 "What do Deutsche and Earl Spey drink every day? It looks delicious..."
 Z24_TouchDialog_6:0 "As a child, I want to rest early..."
 Z24_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Morning(yawning) sleepy...please ask me for a leave, I'll sleep for a while..."
 Z24_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Sir, since we are all a family, it shouldn't matter if my task is entrusted to you... I'll help you sleep a little longer..."
 Z24_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It hurts to death... Just because I was sleepy and took a nap while completing the task, I was attacked by the enemy... But thanks to it, I can sleep for several days... What is the Chinese saying? Speaking of it...there is no blessing if you are incapable of defeating oneself."
 Z24_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It's dark, the good boy should go to bed... Sir, come, go to bed with me..."
 Z24_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "What? There are still jobs in the middle of the night? Too anti-human... The first guy who asked others to work in the middle of the night should be sentenced to death..."
 Z24_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Why... Shane, Sister Bismarck are so energetic at night, don't you need to rest... Huh...huh..."
 Z28_TouchDialog_1:0 "You can rest assured that the command of the battlefield is handed over to me, and I will not lose if I talk about strategy."
 Z28_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sister Scharnhorst looks hard to approach, but she is actually a good old man."
 Z28_TouchDialog_3:0 "Tsk... the sound of the carrier aircraft is very harsh."
 Z28_TouchDialog_4:0 "If you make tactics like this... Ah! Sir, you interrupted me, please don't do strange things while working."
 Z28_TouchDialog_5:0 "This is today's summary report. Although there are still many shortcomings, it should be enough for use."
 Z28_TouchDialog_6:0 "Z24...I really can't do anything with her. The hard-working officer accommodates her every day."
 Z28_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The latest battle situation...not optimistic. You can sleep for a while, sir, but after I finish the battle situation analysis, I need to see you sober."
  Z28_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Please allow me to use my personal relationship to propose to you, either to use military expenses to build a tactical discussion room that can be completely soundproofed, or to prohibit the group of aircraft carriers from flying near here, so noisy me! There is no way to calm down. think!"
 Z28_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I feel that twenty-four hours a day is really not enough... I have to accompany you, do strategic planning, and be noisy by the buzzing of those planes. It's really bad..."
 Z28_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Not enough, not enough, not enough! Time is not enough, sir, I need to calm down, I need to... hey hey, why suddenly hold me... let go, let go... I'm sorry, I'm impulsive... next , Leave it to you, can you?"
 Z28_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It is great to have you by my side when I lose my calm..."
 Z28_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "If you are bored, accompany me to the next chess game, hoo-this is one of the few pastimes I like."
 Z31_TouchDialog_1:0 "I will record every time my sisters fight so that I can learn better."
 Z31_TouchDialog_2:0 "Z31 will try to catch up with your sisters!"
 Z31_TouchDialog_3:0 "The 150mm gun accidentally sunk... Don't worry about me, this weight is no problem."
 Z31_TouchDialog_4:0 "The sir is here. I'm sorting out the notes my sisters gave me. It's very rewarding."
 Z31_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sir, do you have any books to learn how to fight? I really want to read more."
 Z31_TouchDialog_6:0 "If you can grow as quickly as possible, it would be nice to play your role."
 Z31_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey, haven't you gotten up yet? The teacher often says that early to bed and early to get up can be good for your health, so just use the phrase that my sister usually wakes me up...Quickly~get up~ bed~! Too~yang~ Sun~to~ fart~share~!"
 Z31_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Sir~This is the battle note I just took on the training ground. You have experienced a lot of battles. See if there are any problems?"
 Z31_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sir, let's go buy some snacks while resting...hehe, I'm a bit greedy."
 Z31_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The weather is a bit cold...Can you sit in your arms and read a book? Hehe, it won't bother you."
 Z31_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hey, give me milk? Thank you sir... I'm not sleepy yet, it's okay, I will tell you when I'm sleepy, don't worry."
 Z31_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Sir, look, this is my own biscuits. Would you like to eat some?...Hehe, it's very sweet."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_1:0 "I am the noble Amethys. I don't do any chores."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_2:0 "My weapon can't be used casually. It needs to be charged during the day, and then it can be used to its fullest power at night."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_3:0 "Training is really hard...Of course there is no need for a noble lady like me!"
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_4:0 "I am not a delusion of secondary disease, I am a great Amethyst adult! Even if you are alone at night! All! No! Questions! Questions!"
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_5:0 "Oh, there is another hole in the clothes, are you going to find the queen... Forget it, I'll sew it by myself when there is no one."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_6:0 "All my friends are noble people, commander, it is your honor to be my friend."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "You quickly open your eyes, this place has been shrouded in darkness, and if you don't run away quickly, it will be eroded by the dark quilt cage."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Today... there is a shadow of a dragon faintly in the sky, an ominous breath, I suspect that your life is in danger, and I will set up a barrier in my name. I will... ah, don't drive me out, I will Quiet."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "My beloved, accept your most glorious mission-stay with me, go for a walk..."
  Amethyst_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Well... If you can't rest in time, the devilish energy in my body will erode my heart, so... I will sleep first."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Have fun with me, common people! Walking with the noble me is your supreme glory!"
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Tonight's moonlight is so beautiful and moving, people can't help but think of the village in their hometown... Oh, no, it's the castle... It's an unforgivable sin to hear what others say!"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_1:0 "I heard that there is a G country heavy cruiser that is very scary... I don't know if I have a chance to be a friend..."
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_2:0 "I will work hard in today's training!"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_3:0 "Do you want to give you the magic of courage?"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_4:0 "It would be nice to usher in peace sooner, so that you can make many, many friends!"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_5:0 "It's a bit embarrassing to keep touching my head...but it doesn't matter! So, you can touch it for a while..."
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_6:0 "The commander is busy so late every day, is his body okay? Firefly hopes that the commander can rest early."
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The commander is awake? Xiaoying reports to you! The commander's office has been cleaned today! Please check!"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Today Xiaoying has learned a new move again. Would you like to perform it for you? Hee hee~"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I will not fear anyone, no matter how strong the enemy is, as long as the commander is behind me, I will...ah, my head hurts, why did the commander knock me?"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Little Firefly...is the new name the commander came up with? Hey, Little Firefly likes it~"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hey, Commander, your clothes are a bit torn, huh, take it off and give it to Xiaoying~☆"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "After the exercise with Hipper today, she dropped a can of candies. If you have a chance, please return it... Why do you just open the can and eat it!... Well, it's... sweet, but is it really good? ?"
 Javelin_TouchDialog_1:0 "Those despicable enemies, please hand over to the javelin to hunt them down, please give me more opportunities to attack!"
 Javelin_TouchDialog_2:0 "This lady hasn't trained enough yet! Who else can...ah, Commander, how about training together?"
 Javelin_TouchDialog_3:0 "Training with the black-backed jackal is the happiest thing. Well, although she seems a little cold..."
 Javelin_TouchDialog_4:0 "It seems to feel a strange signal on the beach... Ah, queen, why are you here... Haha, it's nothing, maybe it's just the sound of the waves."
 Javelin_TouchDialog_5:0 "Commander, I, can I come in to accompany you?...I'm so happy, it seems that the commander doesn't hate me!"
 Javelin_TouchDialog_6:0 "If you don’t die in a catastrophe, there must be a blessing...? If you are just yourself, I am afraid you will be disgusted..."
 Javelin_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Please rest assured, with you by my side, I will not fail. Victory is not far away from us."
 Javelin_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The power of my gun hasn't been fully utilized yet, but what is going on... Oh, yes, I remember it, the last time I saw you were attacked by the deep sea, it suddenly broke out... or else , You try again?"
 Javelin_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Would you like to see me training? I will perform even better if you are there~!"
 Javelin_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "So, did Senior Acasta care about me?...Why didn't she tell her by herself, and...Why didn't she tell me...Really, I misunderstood her... Commander, come with me to find Let her, explain those things to her clearly."
 Javelin_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hey! Phewstill failed to break my own record, really... I need to exercise more... Did the commander bring water? Let me drink some..."
 Javelin_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I just like fighting, because as long as I defeat all the people who can be defeated, won't the world be peaceful?...I don't want you to live in crisis every day like now. Isn't that good?"
 Juno_TouchDialog_1:0 "Lower your body~ um... okay! As a commander, you can't be sloppy. Even a button can't be sloppy."
 Juno_TouchDialog_2:0 "Today's training was really interesting, but Miss Javelin and Miss Black Jackal both tried too hard~"
 Juno_TouchDialog_3:0 "Huh? Commander, you have also come to the tea party with your concubine, hee hee~ It seems that your taste is also quite good."
 Juno_TouchDialog_4:0 "Recently, the spirit of the Javelin was in a trance, and I received the news that the deep sea might be attacked... Sure enough, let's inform the seniors to help protect her."
 Juno_TouchDialog_5:0 "The commander has gotten very close with other friends recently, but he has been a little colder on his concubine. Isn't it because he hates concubine?"
 Juno_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, the weather has changed a bit recently. My concubine has knitted some clothes for you. Would you like to try it?"
 Juno_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Will you not take me with you when you go out today?...Ah, nothing, I just confirm it, are you really not taking me?"
  Juno_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The concubine body will not interfere with your decision, but...As a good helper, I think the concubine body is obligated to regulate your behavior, what do you think?"
 Juno_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It feels good to see everyone working hard and sweating...the concubine will work hard too. Commander, do you prefer me in battle, or usually me?"
 Juno_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Tonight is only you and me. I made the best dishes... Don't worry, not those dishes, please feel free to eat...Ah, why not, let me feed you, open your mouth, ah----"
 Juno_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It's really good, there is nothing left to eat! ... It seems that you are also very satisfied... Concubine body is very happy, tonight, I will depend on you for everything~"
 Juno_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The concubine body, the concubine body is by your side, there is no desire for nothing~! Hush-don't talk, the concubine body just wants to lean on your shoulders,"
 Jackal_TouchDialog_1:0 "Javelin, although she works very hard. But excessive enthusiasm and belligerence will harm her..."
 Jackal_TouchDialog_2:0 "Although Senior Acasta is a bit lazy, he doesn't feel sluggish in handling things. Some parts are like me."
 Jackal_TouchDialog_3:0 "Aren't you used to the noisy atmosphere of the harbor... It's not bad to sit next to me, okay... forget it."
 Jackal_TouchDialog_4:0 "Assassins in the East seem to like to study some complicated truths, but for me, I only need to know who the next target is."
 Jackal_TouchDialog_5:0 "Why is the javelin dangling there alone? The queen is also here... Hey, forget it, am I hiding here alone..."
 Jackal_TouchDialog_6:0 "Don't worry, Commander, it's me! But you are too paralyzed. It feels a bit unreliable..."
 Jackal_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Since I have such a close relationship with you, can I apply for solo training?... Can't it? Does it mean that communicating with people and establishing close relationships is also a training? Alas, it's a bit sad. "
 Jackal_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "If hunting with Miss Nelson might be a good activity...ah! Commander, I didn't say anything strange, hunting or something, I'm not interested... oh... I missed..."
 Jackal_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Take a rest? I really don't know what to do... Hey, it should be very comfortable to sleep on your lap. Hmm-is it okay?"
 Jackal_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It is purely unexpected to be moved by your sincere feelings. You have already decided to take care of everything by yourself. As a result, you still want someone to be with you in your heart?"
 Jackal_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It's night, I'm going to patrol... it doesn't matter, I will be back soon."
 Jackal_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It's strange, it seems that I am also being changed by you. Although I don't know how to express this change, I believe it must be good if it is related to you."
 Cossack_TouchDialog_1:0 "No matter when, you can't lose to others from the "momentum"!"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_2:0 "Commander! Are you coming to supervise the situation in the exercise field? It is currently a tribal-level lead! Ha!"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_3:0 "A battle can most stimulate fighting spirit! The Royal Navy will not lose to the enemy in any way!"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_4:0 "Oh oh! Isn't this an Oscar? Why are you here, did you come to me specifically? Haha, I happen to have a small fish here!"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_5:0 "Hey! Ha! Then wave it like this! Ah, isn't this the commander? It just so happens, will you come and have a one-on-one combat with me? Very interesting! Please trust me!"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_6:0 ""The wind and waves have not yet subsided, the gentleness is about to come, and the sea will turn into a royal bed--"Well...It's really nostalgic..."
 Cossack_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Everyone's talents are different. There are no incompetent people, only lazy people who don't want to be motivated!"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I bought too much cat food, so just give it to others. Oscar, what is your name, you can't finish so much!"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The guy over there, come here! Read what is written on the sign, "Feeding is prohibited here! "The feeding area is at the back, remember it for me!"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I occasionally go to the zoo to do a part-time job~ It’s killing two birds with one stone to be able to see so many animals up close and make money~"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "When I feel depressed, I will come here to sing. It only takes a while to restore my mood~ This is also a kind of "magic"."
 Cossack_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "What is this weird thing? Uh, here is the tail... Wow! It turned out to be a horn! A new species has been discovered! I need to contact the director as soon as possible"
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_1:0 "When I was with Miss Nelson, I always felt like I was about to burn...well, it burned in a physical sense."
  Eskimo_TouchDialog_2:0 "It's really hard to get used to the climate here... Obviously I didn't think so at the beginning..."
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_3:0 "The name is just a pronoun. These things will not help you during the battle, so there is no need to care about it."
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_4:0 "Huh, the evening breeze of the port is really blessed on my body."
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_5:0 "With such a big ship mounted on my back, will I be tall or not...just kidding, haha..."
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_6:0 "Do you ask me why I am carrying this? Because it is a very important thing, if it is lost, it will be troublesome... well, very troublesome..."

 Punjabi_TouchDialog_4:0 "Ohhhh Joe... the Prince of Wales!
 Punjabi_TouchDialog_5:0 "A pleasant night~ Ah, the feeling of the breeze is really intoxicating~"

 Fletcher_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey hey hey! Don't run around! Don't disturb other people's work! My goodness! William, what are you holding in your hand?!"
 Fletcher_TouchDialog_4:0 "Finally put the group of children to sleep... Alas, when are these days?"
 Fletcher_TouchDialog_5:0 "The role of radar is not just a good-looking on paper. From the beginning, you can seize the opportunity and have a panoramic view of the enemy's movements, and you can stand in an invincible position."

 CassinYoung_TouchDialog_3:0 "It is not so easy to break through my air defense net! Even... Occasionally omission of one is excusable!"
 CassinYoung_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sitting on the beach quietly like this, listening to the sound of the sea, is also a good pastime."
 CassinYoung_TouchDialog_5:0 "Check...main guns, torpedo tubes, anti-aircraft machine guns...OK! The state is great! You can attack at any time!"

 Anthony_TouchDialog_3:0 "Huh? Was the commander calling me just now? Ah, was it Z1... I subconsciously thought I was in country G."
 Anthony_TouchDialog_4:0 "The seaside at night is also good, let's go for a stroll after the duty is over."

 Braine_TouchDialog_3:0 "If you want to help others...but you will always involuntarily play pranks...well, it's really a headache."
 Braine_TouchDialog_4:0 "Kasinyan doesn't look angry? I... should I apologize..."
 Braine_TouchDialog_5:0 "It's really great to be able to sit down and chat with sisters in the port area. It's really great not to be alone..."

 Gearing_TouchDialog_3:0 "Keeling takes everything very seriously! Look...trust me!"
 Gearing_TouchDialog_4:0 "It is so happy to be with the Commander every night."
 Gearing_TouchDialog_5:0 "How...how can I not bite my tongue."
  Gearing_TouchDialog_6:0 "I wish I could prove myself on the real battlefield one day."
 Gearing_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Commander--! Killing's homemade breakfast! Although it may not be delicious..."
 Gearing_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Woo... I accidentally bit my tongue again... Hey, Commander, is this for me? Thanks, thank you!... It's cool and comfortable to use."
 Gearing_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "This... um, just~ want~ slow~ speak~ talk, even~ see~ you~ you~ very~ exciting~ moving~, also~ no~ bite~ to~ tongue~ head ~!"
 Gearing_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Commander, you see, this is the training plan I made for myself. I just need to work hard... Do you want to see it? Then I will adjust the time again. I will work with you and you will train with me. Perfect. Hehe~"
 Gearing_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, are you going to stay up late tonight? Commander, please wait a moment~ I'll make you a cup of coffee."
 Gearing_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "These files are too hard to read... I'm sorry I can't help you."
 Gyatt_TouchDialog_1:0 "Yo~ Commander finally didn't sleep in late today, but if I didn't prepare gifts for Keeling, I won't let you go!"
 Gyatt_TouchDialog_2:0 "So sleepy... I had so much fun last night that I didn't sleep well, so don't let me participate in training anymore, hehe~"
 Gyatt_TouchDialog_3:0 "Training, what is that? Hey, there is candy to eat when you are done? Let's make a fuss."
 Gyatt_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, don't forget to give me some prizes after you finish your work, otherwise, hey, don't think about taking a good rest tonight~"
 Gyatt_TouchDialog_5:0 "This is Keeling's breakfast tomorrow? Hey... I'll add a little condiment to her-hey, commander... why are you here, oh-it hurts!"
 Gyatt_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, commander...ah, are you asleep? Hehe, let's draw something!"
 Gyatt_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I promised you how to train! Why should I train if you don't train! Gyatt is very dissatisfied! I want to protest!"
 Gyatt_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Isn’t the essence of battle is destruction? Pranks are actually a kind of destruction... Then, I’m going to learn about pranks, isn’t it a way to improve my fighting ability, don’t... don’t drag me!"
 Gyatt_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Commander, I want to be with you. Just the two of us, dating in a place where no one is disturbed. Would you like to take me to a place like this? I really love you... Ahhh-Frank! Why are you so... Take me away, Commander! I don't want to train!"
 Gyatt_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "How can you not take risks at night? Commander, put down your work and start a new adventure with me!"
 Gyatt_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Put some pepper here, some mustard here... Then the commander will definitely find water, if it's in the water...hee hee, add some salt~"
 Gyatt_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "There is a saying... People like to tease people they like... It’s because I like you, I love you more than everyone else, so I will try my best to tease you! I, I really love You...So, don't punish me, okay..."
 FrankKnox_TouchDialog_1:0 "Tactical training...well, it is also essential."
 FrankKnox_TouchDialog_2:0 "It would be nice if you could be in a more important position, so that you can do more things within your capacity... At this point, Commander, you have to come on."
 FrankKnox_TouchDialog_3:0 "Ball, what about Bauer! Come and take care of Kiat...ahh!
 FrankKnox_TouchDialog_4:0 "Are you at work... Don't worry, I won't disturb you, please concentrate on your work, I will read the book for a while, Kiat is a bit... Well, if you can understand it, please, if you need help, please calls me."
 FrankKnox_TouchDialog_5:0 "Only fighting is an effective means of sanctioning evil."
 FrankKnox_TouchDialog_6:0 "No matter where you come from or what you have done before, you must remember that we are now comrades in the fight together."
 FrankKnox_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Did you quarrel with the commander? Sorry, I'll take Keeling out first... She was cried by Keat again... It's a headache..."
 FrankKnox_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Although I can't be as confident and good as the prestige maid, it is easy to help you with some official duties. But you are not allowed to be lazy. The motivation for my work comes from your hard work."
 FrankKnox_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "What binds us together? Is it this boring job? Or this cruel and unrelenting war? However, your presence barely gives me the motivation to work."
 FrankKnox_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I always wanted to be able to hold an important position, until the moment you confessed, I realized that the most important position is to be your partner."
 FrankKnox_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Do you think that the port area where we live every day always brings us different surprises, let us discover that there is beauty in this cruel life."
 FrankKnox_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Telling history is not what I am good at. After all, I like heroes and tell stories of heroes, but there is often no such hero in life."
 Power_TouchDialog_1:0 "Today's training...why, I don't have enough energy, but I will try my best."
  Power_TouchDialog_2:0 "Today's patrol plan...well, it feels very easy, Commander, I will go to perform the task, you have to come on!"
 Power_TouchDialog_3:0 "Commander, did you see where Keeling went? Today Kiat added a lot of mustard to her breakfast, but I haven’t seen her since... Hey, what, Kiat, you go again Mess with Frank..."
 Power_TouchDialog_4:0 "Obviously the eldest sister, but Keeling is always crying by Kiat... It's a headache..."
 Power_TouchDialog_5:0 "Ah-Commander, let me lean on you for a while... It's so tiring to deal with all kinds of things every day..."
 Power_TouchDialog_6:0 "Actually, Commander, as long as you pay more attention to Kiat and Keeling, maybe... Kiat won't be so naughty anymore."
 Power_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Are there any arrangements for today? If so... I won't bother you."
 Power_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "This is a refreshment for you. If you need it, just take it out of the incubator and eat it!...Time is too late, I'm going to train!"
 Power_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Commander, Commander, are you free today? Let's clean up together!"
 Power_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "My sisters...Does the Commander like it?...Do you hate it?...Great, and worry that so many things every day will make the Commander hate..."
 Power_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Bauer will try his best to help you!...whoo-a bit dissatisfied with the weaker self..."
 Power_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Frank! Quickly drag Kiat away! (Whispering) I'm making an appointment with the commander! Why didn't you take good care of her... it's over, it's all over..."
 Reshitelny_TouchDialog_1:0 "Whoever says that a destroyer can't be a flagship, as long as you work hard enough and don't be lazy, everyone has a chance to become a flagship!"
 Reshitelny_TouchDialog_2:0 "Air strikes? Huh huh~ If there are any, it's up to me to knock them all down!"
 Reshitelny_TouchDialog_3:0 "Comrades, in addition to being strong, it is also necessary to assist the other companions in the weak port area."
 Reshitelny_TouchDialog_4:0 "At night, be especially careful of the invasion of those who are unruly, and you must not underestimate the enemy."
 Reshitelny_TouchDialog_5:0 "Offshore dominance and routes must be ensured. Only in this way can we maintain the initiative in battle."
 Reshitelny_TouchDialog_6:0 "Comrades, in addition to devoting themselves to battle, they must also pay attention to the improvement of their own knowledge level. Only in this way can we ensure that the fruits of victory will not be stolen."
 Reshitelny_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Comrade, although the situation is not very optimistic, you should also pay attention to your daily diet and work and rest. The body is the capital of the revolution."
 Reshitelny_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "There are a lot of scenery in the port area that is not in my hometown. I don't know when I can record all these and show them to my friends in my hometown... Would you like to accompany me?"
 Reshitelny_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Comrade, don't be so depressed because of a momentary failure. Even if you are driven to a dead end, you will have little hope if you fight to the death. If you are really sad... come into my arms."
 Reshitelny_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I heard that there are some places in the world where you can see flowers in all seasons. Have you been to those places? ... I really want to live there. It must be beautiful."
 Reshitelny_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Beautiful clothes, beautiful dress...Will you like it? Hey, I actually want to try it... Can I be as beautiful as everyone else?"
 Reshitelny_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Comrade, do you...like dancing? I heard that there will be a dance party next week. I hope you can come with me."
 Vauquelin_TouchDialog_1:0 "General, today...what can I do for you today?"
 Vauquelin_TouchDialog_2:0 "General, is my performance today satisfactory?"
 Vauquelin_TouchDialog_3:0 "Obviously not weak, but I feel that I am always unable to play a role..."
 Vauquelin_TouchDialog_4:0 "The general is so tired at work every day, he must pay attention to his body, otherwise...it will be worrying."
 Vauquelin_TouchDialog_5:0 "Today's performance...seems to be better than before...Is it? The general thinks so too, it's great."
 Vauquelin_TouchDialog_6:0 "I really want to have the opportunity to be active on the front line with friends from Country F..."
 Vauquelin_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Um...this is, breakfast...is it good and delicious..."
 Vauquelin_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Oh, oh! Did you make a mistake again? I... General, does it matter?... Hey, thank you."
 Vauquelin_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I have never felt before. Is the current me reflected in your eyes or imprinted in your heart? I am curious."
 Vauquelin_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Yes, can I just stay by your side? It won't cause you trouble..."
 Vauquelin_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Do you care about me? I, I also care about you, hehe, it seems to be connected with you."
 Vauquelin_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Is this...is this coffee for me? Ah...I actually forgot to make coffee for you who are busy at work, hug, sorry, and let you personally...this coffee is delicious. Hey..."
  LeFantasque_TouchDialog_1:0 "Too fast is also a sin, do you have to wait for them occasionally?"
 LeFantasque_TouchDialog_2:0 "The most enjoyable speed training begins!"
 LeFantasque_TouchDialog_3:0 "If something interesting happens, please tell me!"
 LeFantasque_TouchDialog_4:0 "Is the night here so soon? Hehe, do you want to do something interesting?"
 LeFantasque_TouchDialog_5:0 "I heard that there is another ship girl whose speed is about the same as mine. I really want to try it."
 LeFantasque_TouchDialog_6:0 "Is the work over? In order to have a good spirit tomorrow, I have to rest quickly~ Then... Goal: bedroom, go ahead at full speed!"
 LeFantasque_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "General, don't be lazy, only keep exercising to keep you healthy! So let's do morning exercises together every morning!"
 LeFantasque_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Eh hey~ no matter how much artillery fires can't hit me!...hey, accident, accident~ you are so good! I definitely won't talk about me, right?"
 LeFantasque_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Ah that it is so boring to be bored in the port area every day!!! let's go out as one with me!"
 LeFantasque_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Will you go to the night run with me? It's good for your body!"
 LeFantasque_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The general's work efficiency is as reliable as my speed, but I don't know if your degree of romance can catch me?"
 LeFantasque_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I walk this road with you every day, hehe, if it has life, it will be the witness of our company!"
 Lion_TouchDialog_1:0 "Where justice prevails, freedom must prevail."
 Lion_TouchDialog_2:0 "As long as I am here, the glory of the Royal Navy will never be covered in dust, and the concubine will take you forward. Commander, please watch."
 Lion_TouchDialog_3:0 "Commander, how is today's mission accomplished? Don't let any slack, otherwise it may fall short."
 Lion_TouchDialog_4:0 "The long-cherished wish of the predecessors will never be allowed to end with me. I will pass it on forever."
 Lion_TouchDialog_5:0 "Avant-garde is a person who is not very confident. The commander should take care of her. There are countless potentials in her body."
 Lion_TouchDialog_6:0 "The commander has worked hard today, and tomorrow's plan is left to the concubine."
 Lion_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Oh? Is this your plan for today? So many blanks are not good, so change all these hours to accompany my favorite people, how about?"
 Lion_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The concubine body training is over, how about you? ... It seems that you have encountered some difficulties, do you need help? But as compensation, please leave the time to the concubine's control."
 Lion_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "This firepower...somewhat can't resist...Damn it, I didn't expect to be suppressed by firepower. I'm really unwilling..."
 Lion_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The Royal Navy, every enemy must fight. This is not just a slogan, but absolute confidence in their own strength. Although the concubine knows that this is not the case anymore, but also hopes to continue this glory, you are willing Come with me?"
 Lion_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Although I haven't seen the strength of the Royal Navy back then, but when I see you, I seem to know why the Royal Navy was so powerful..."
 Lion_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The stars at night are so beautiful... Do they shine like this during the day?"
 Nagato_TouchDialog_1:0 "This overwhelming firepower is one of the best even among the Big Seven on the Naval Holiday."
 Nagato_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sister, uh... that guy is a bit too loose... It's a headache."
 Nagato_TouchDialog_3:0 "Even if the times change, the fire of war in my heart will never go out."
 Nagato_TouchDialog_4:0 "Don't be slack. Admiral, you have to lead by example. If there is no other business, please follow me around the port area."
 Nagato_TouchDialog_5:0 "Um... Sister, don't play pranks at this time... ahem, you didn't see what happened just now..."
 Nagato_TouchDialog_6:0 "I will handle these files. It happens to be my area of ​​expertise. The power of BIG SEVEN is not limited to combat!"
 Nagato_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "As the flagship of the fleet, we must not only take care of ourselves, but also care about every member of the fleet. Assign them the most suitable positions so that they can exert their 100% strength."
 Nagato_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The fastest way to shut up the good guys is to use force to make them surrender. Reasonable? There is no need to be reasonable when dealing with such people."
 Nagato_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "You have been harassed by that guy too...I don't know how she developed her character, it's really a headache."
 Nagato_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Don't dangle by my side... I can just eat this tempura, alas, you can't help it..."
 Nagato_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "My sister's cooking is unexpectedly delicious...I didn't realize this before. She seems to have made some for you too-it seems that I am not alone."
 Nagato_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Although the soundproofing effect of the exercise field is very good, it can't completely block the fire of the large-caliber gun. If you want to fight with me, wait until dawn. Don't disturb other people's work and rest."
 Mutsu_TouchDialog_1:0 "Does it affect the work of the admiral? It's better to take a break."
 Mutsu_TouchDialog_2:0 "Looking at my sister's seriousness, I can't help but tease her~ Admiral, do you want to be together?"
 Mutsu_TouchDialog_3:0 "Tri-type bombs are very good equipment, but the third turret always feels a little bad..."
  Mutsu_TouchDialog_4:0 "Admiral, have you seen my sister~ Ha ha, she ran really fast~ By the way, you can also help find it~ After all, it’s late at night~"
 Mutsu_TouchDialog_5:0 "The power of the three-style bomb... Ah? What are you laughing at? If you don't believe it, do you want to experience it yourself~"
 Mutsu_TouchDialog_6:0 "Uh-huh~ the tempura is about to be fried-ah, admiral, why did you come to the kitchen? If you are hungry, please wait there for a while. This one is for my sister~ "
 Mutsu_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "If you care about me so much, you might as well post it closer~ This way you will look more carefully~ Don't be shy, I won't care~"
 Mutsu_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "That being said, don't get into the inch~ Be careful I knock your head with the anchor. I'm confident that you will only have a concussion and not see any injuries."
 Mutsu_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I don't know what the wine in her gourd smells like... Even if you ask her, she doesn't mean to share it. Otherwise, would you help me get some more?"
 Mutsu_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Today's tempura is made of matsutake. You don't want to miss it, right? Go sit there. Patience is a virtue."
 Mutsu_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Sister~Don't read that book, come and taste the tempura I just made~Don't hide from me, it won't explode after a bite. Take a bite~Just take a bite~Come on~"
 Mutsu_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Want to fight me? Hey, it's very troublesome, just count as you win. I have other things to do, can you please stop pestering me?"
 RoyalOak_TouchDialog_1:0 "The deck... always feels a bit dangerous..."
 RoyalOak_TouchDialog_2:0 "Today's training will also work hard... (sleepy)"
 RoyalOak_TouchDialog_3:0 "Non-interference combat...It's really a wonderful tactic."
 RoyalOak_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, can I apply to plant oak trees in the port area? This is a very effective concealment method~"
 RoyalOak_TouchDialog_5:0 "It's so late, but I haven't finished work yet, the Royal Oak is going to rest~"
 RoyalOak_TouchDialog_6:0 "Hoo...hhhhhihihihihhh been been been any an enemy already been been been been been been been been been seen attracted any enemy been been been been been been been been been been seen used any been been been been inspected been inspected been checked been checked, a h been already been been been been been checked all been been checked yet!

 Warspite_TouchDialog_1:0 "The power of the Super Dreadnought-class battleship will never allow anyone to underestimate it. Even if there are occasional accidents, it can be adjusted in time."
 Warspite_TouchDialog_2:0 "Elegant and confident. This is the embodiment of the Royal Navy's spirit in daily life. It is not something that anyone can imitate."
  Warspite_TouchDialog_3:0 "Elizabeth, are you ready? Although you are named Queen, I will never show mercy to you because of this."
 Warspite_TouchDialog_4:0 "Dangerous breath still lingers around the port area. It seems that my mission has not been completed."
 Warspite_TouchDialog_5:0 "Are you working? The commander really has the self-control that a soldier should have. It seems that I have been worrying too much."
 Warspite_TouchDialog_6:0 "I can't accompany the commander tonight. I'm going to tell stories to the younger generations... the inheritance of the naval spirit is very important."
 Warspite_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Fighting is a very dangerous thing, little guys...Come on, Z17, let me hold you so you won't get hurt, good...hee hee, really cute little guy."
 Warspite_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Records are used to break. At this point, I have to educate my younger generations... um? Veneto, what did you say? Repeat it again? Want to taste my cannonballs like your predecessors? "
 Warspite_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Think of every attack as a trip, and the enemy is just the scenery along the way... If you think about it this way, do you look forward to the next battle?"
 Warspite_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I have been given the fate of fighting since the moment I was born, but with you, I understand the meaning of fighting."
 Warspite_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The dinner is really good, but I ate a little too much. Would you like to go out for a walk?...Ah, can you help me with the skirt? Hehe, it's really elegant."
 Warspite_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Good luck, I caught up with the prom, how about it? Would you like to invite me to dance? Commander."
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_1:0 "I don't know how many times I have done this training. I have long been familiar with it."
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_2:0 "Commander, please send me to battle next time, I am completely ready!"
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_3:0 "Commander, can I help you with any official duties?"
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_4:0 "Daily training and exercises are to better put yourself in actual combat, but when can you have actual combat..."
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_5:0 "As long as this...whoop...if we can do better...Next time I fight, I can go into battle as the main force... one more time!"
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_6:0 "I am the glory of the Royal Navy!...No, it's not right, it's not like this...I am the crystallization of Deutsche Technology...In this case...Ah, commander, I just want to play the role of the predecessor occasionally. Look."
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hoo-it is a hearty exercise, if it is a real battle, it would be even better..."
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Senior Hood, how do you deal with battleships better? You are a senior, there must be... Ay, don’t go! Did I, I say something wrong?"
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "No matter how chaotic the outside, this harbor is so peaceful, the predecessors must not waste their efforts for this!"
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "With your encouragement, I have allowed me to persist until now, and I will not let you down."
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Although I always say that my current strength is not enough... But when will I be tall..."
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Commander, one day, can I catch up with the predecessors?"
  Tennessee_TouchDialog_1:0 "Oh, isn't this a commander. Are you going to come and train with me? It will become super strong!"
 Tennessee_TouchDialog_2:0 "California... it's okay to stay together, but you have to complete the training on time."
 Tennessee_TouchDialog_3:0 "Stay in the port area will make it rusty! Commander, come out with me to destroy the enemy!"
 Tennessee_TouchDialog_4:0 "Training on time and rest on time, forming good habits is also a part of getting stronger."
 Tennessee_TouchDialog_5:0 "The child is not around, a little bit lonely... It's okay! It's the number one on duty! This is work."

 California_TouchDialog_2:0 "Tennessee, don't go, do it again, wait, wait until I recover... Let's try again!"
 California_TouchDialog_3:0 "The commander looks very leisurely today, but now I don't have time to accompany you. This is my position and I can't leave."
 California_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hey, the commander always said so childishly, nothing more, just treat it as a reward for your hard work...Come on, please have a good sleep."
 California_TouchDialog_5:0 "The winning percentage in the fight against Nevada...and Tennessee...ah, Commander, you are peeking at me again. These are my precious records."

 Colorado_TouchDialog_2:0 "Confidence comes from strong strength, and arrogance comes from strong...imagination?"
 Colorado_TouchDialog_3:0 "Be cautious and act every step of the way. This is my fighting style."
 Colorado_TouchDialog_4:0 "Huh...I feel tight and tired every day. Hey-Commander, what are you going to do! Ah, rub my shoulders... It's much more comfortable, thank you Commander for the massage."
 Colorado_TouchDialog_5:0 "Although Maryland is very capable of fighting, such a character is a double-edged sword after all..."
 Colorado_TouchDialog_6:0 "The stars outside tonight are very beautiful, commander, do you want to... be seen through? Let's set off together."
 Colorado_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "In such a sea breeze, it is a waste of you to close the doors and windows...Occasionally, please breathe some fresh air~"
 Colorado_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Commander, did you see Maryland?... Hey? She told me that she was looking for you! Damn... Where did the girl go..."
 Colorado_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hey! Are you, have you come back?...Ha, haha, how can I be nervous...can you not go to the kitchen for now? Hey...Why is there a smell of burning again? Oops, forget to turn off NS……"
 Colorado_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Ah-Commander, why are you still not asleep?...Wait for me? Well, don't wait for me next time. I work hard so I hope you can sleep peacefully. You do not seem to be mine. Efforts are in vain..."
 Colorado_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Oh, it’s really rare that the commander would come out for a walk at this time. But look at your expression...couldn’t you be expecting something like an encounter...hehe, then I really let you catch it. ."
 Colorado_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "On vacation...Although the Grand Canyon is beautiful, should you go to the beach..."
 Maryland_TouchDialog_1:0 "Although I am the second ship, I am two years earlier than the other sisters~"
 Maryland_TouchDialog_2:0 "I really hope that the design of the ship can take more into consideration the power aspect...because this problem has delayed too many fighters."
 Maryland_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey hey hey, do you want to surpass the predecessors with this level of firepower? It's too tender, come and fight with me again. Come on!"
 Maryland_TouchDialog_4:0 "Actually, I am not aggressive, but I want to be stronger. How can I become stronger without fighting~ Commander, are you right?"
 Maryland_TouchDialog_5:0 "It is my honor to be listed as the big seven with many outstanding people, and I will cherish this honor."
 Maryland_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, I have been working for a long time, why don't you join me in a fight? Let’s move your muscles and bones~"
 Maryland_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Haha~ I won another game, is anyone coming... Ah, no, the commander is here, you guys can help me think about how to prevaricate the past, but I can’t be found out and I’ll fight again. NS!"
 Maryland_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I was the first in today's battle again! ... Oh, don't care about my injuries, it's no big deal."
 Maryland_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Commander, do you want to go out and fight with me so that you can understand the sentence "the battle itself is the meaning"."
 Maryland_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It’s a bit troublesome, Commander, now it’s up to you... Yes, give me some medicine... Hey! It hurts!... Be lighter... It seems that you are not good at this kind of thing, hehe, Do you want sister to teach you?"
 Maryland_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Ah(yawning), really boring work, is there any refreshing alcoholic beverage...Ha, is there only coffee? Um... if you make it yourself, taste it."
 Maryland_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Fighting is more fun than processing files, and staying by your side is more fun than being alone. Alas, it’s a contradictory choice..."
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_1:0 "Sister, one is steady, one is heroic... If I, oh... I still can't do it."
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_2:0 "I heard someone questioned the power of the 16-inch gun. Although I am not very strong myself... but it is enough to teach the arrogant guy."
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_3:0 "It's so refreshing to fight with my sisters!"
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, my sisters don't seem to be there, can I help you?"
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_5:0 "Huh? Is it dark already? Didn't you notice, I will help you with your work after training for a while."
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_6:0 "The fireworks at night are so beautiful, Commander, I am very good at setting fireworks~!"
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ma, Sister Maryland, don't fight so fiercely... I can't beat you, it hurts... Commander, save me!"
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Although it is tied for the big seven... but what should we do? At least not loose, just start with the morning exercise! Commander, do you want to accompany me?"
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Huh-do you know how good I am?...Ah, Commander, I'm not enjoying the battle... You, you won't hate me for that..."
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_oathed_4: 0 "call - call - even if there are outstanding predecessors, I do not want to admit defeat ah ......"
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huh-my sisters are finally gone, although they care about me very much, but I also want to have time alone with you..."
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I want to make myself special in your heart, but...what do you want to do...it's a headache, but the battle is simpler and easier...Ah, you don't hate such a girl..."
 Washington_TouchDialog_1:0 "Has today's battle plan been formulated?"
  Washington_TouchDialog_2:0 "Commander, please don't mention a name in front of me, that is a shame to the Navy! Please bear in mind."
 Washington_TouchDialog_3:0 "I really like the commander's rigorous and pragmatic style of doing things. To maintain the harmonious order of the fleet, what is needed is that everyone abides by the rules."
 Washington_TouchDialog_4:0 "Summarize the shortcomings of each day in order to make yourself better every day."
 Washington_TouchDialog_5:0 "In my eyes, whether it is a smart and cute destroyer or a mighty battleship, everyone should be equal and share the opportunity to fight."
 Washington_TouchDialog_6:0 "The purpose of war is for freedom, but it is destruction in itself, which is really a contradiction."
 Washington_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "You have always worked so hard, that's why I can't forget it, haha... such a hardworking gardener, it's hard to justify not giving any awards..."
 Washington_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Did I do some weird things when I was young?...I really envy my childhood, being so carefree."
 Washington_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Fruit is not missing for breakfast, here~ Go on! If you don't finish it, I won't let you go~"
 Washington_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Reality is often more magical than what is described in novels, and it is unbelievable. I actually had a day of fighting with Kirishima. You are really amazing~"
 Washington_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I know you really want to mediate the relationship between me and South Dakota, but it seems to be destined. I can't control my emotions when I see her. I'm afraid...she is the same. But, isn't this also good? At least, not too boring..."
 Washington_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "With you, the ideal of building a just and free country in my dreams should be realized."
 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_1:0 "Come and have a cup of coffee, and then go to work hard, sir."
 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_2:0 "Whether it is to compare with the old big seven, or to contend with those new and cutting-edge battleships, I will not fall into the wind."
 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_3:0 "My sisters are still young, you may be troubled sir for many things."
 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_4:0 "I don't want to be always treated as a child... Sir, I don't need to go to bed so early, wait until you finish your work!"
 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_5:0 "The night is getting dark. Have a cup of coffee to refresh yourself. I made it by myself. I hope you like it."
 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_6:0 "The sea breeze at night is really refreshing. It reminds me of the years in Sicily..."
 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "It’s not good to eat so gluttonously. From the first appetizer to the last dessert with coffee, it’s a little bit of careful tasting before it counts as a diet...Of course, I don’t ask those people in country F that much, they It's normal not to understand."
 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Are you going to work? Let's have an Espresso together. Do you like it... If you are not used to it, please let me know and I won't prepare it for you next time."
 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It's not impossible to ask me for help... After all, your behavior of hanging a beautiful lady aside while working alone is too bad."
 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Damn it, only Western food and coffee I can never lose to others. This is the glory that belongs to country I alone. Tonight, I will taste this dessert with the sir... Well, the sir will definitely do it. like!"
 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Is this dinner? Hmm... it's delicious, but it's a shame to lack wine... don't forget it next time. By the way, do you want Canolo?"
 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Don't be so slouched, there are still many tasks waiting for us to complete... Or do I need to use a unique name to encourage you? Amore mio."
 Richelieu_TouchDialog_1:0 "Whether it is the former motherland or the current port, I will guard it with the sword in my hand!"
 Richelieu_TouchDialog_2:0 "General! The war is urgent, please don't do anything unrelated."
 Richelieu_TouchDialog_3:0 "The general can safely let me go on the expedition, don't worry, I won't get hurt."
 Richelieu_TouchDialog_4:0 "The starlight at night in the port area reminds me of my former hometown..."
 Richelieu_TouchDialog_5:0 "Thanks for your hard work, please rest assured, Richelieu will accompany you no matter when you work."
 Richelieu_TouchDialog_6:0 "Fighting with the deceased may be the only thing on the battlefield that will make me hesitate... Don't worry, even so, I will protect my homeland and country as the most important thing."
 Richelieu_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "With you by my side, no matter what I do, I feel very at ease."
 Richelieu_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Your mind is with me every day, no matter training or resting, I am not alone anymore."
 Richelieu_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The edge of the sword needs to be constantly polished to stay sharp, and only by being vigilant at all times can you be prepared... Don't worry, you don't need to be as nervous as I am. It is enough to have me here."
 Richelieu_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The wind at night is really refreshing. I was a little tired after training just now, do you want to walk around with me?"
 Richelieu_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Your strength is too weak. From today on, I will teach you some basic self-defense techniques... Don't be afraid, I will try to be gentle."
 Richelieu_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "This beautiful place, I will never allow anyone to destroy it, never!"
 Scharnhorst_TouchDialog_1:0 "Um...Good morning, sir, my head hurts. I drank too much last night. It seems...I didn't say anything strange, right?"
 Scharnhorst_TouchDialog_2:0 "Gnai--! Tell me what you did to my Caesar while I was drunk! Don't run!"
 Scharnhorst_TouchDialog_3:0 "I was doing artillery practice with me today... Is it Na, Nelson?! Oh... So it's prestige, which surprised me."
 Scharnhorst_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sir, is the work over? Bismarck and I are going to have a drink, do you want to be together?"
 Scharnhorst_TouchDialog_5:0 "(whispering) Hey, the clothes are a bit tight again... the sir will not find out..."
 Scharnhorst_TouchDialog_6:0 "On the issue of my sister, Bismarck and I really have the same disease..."

  Gneisenau_TouchDialog_1:0 "Sister? It's on duty now, do you have other things to be busy?"
 Gneisenau_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sir, your port area is really well-organized. It's what I think."
 Gneisenau_TouchDialog_3:0 "Is it Nelson who just walked past? Tsk... I was a little nervous."
 Gneisenau_TouchDialog_4:0 "The night is full of opportunities and challenges! Don't you go out and explore together? Sir."
 Gneisenau_TouchDialog_5:0 "Do you want to process official documents? Not bad. I will help you."
 Gneisenau_TouchDialog_6:0 "The port area at night is still so beautiful, you must have spent a lot of effort."
 Gneisenau_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sir, can you call Wichita? I want to share with her her experience dealing with aircraft carriers."
 Gneisenau_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Only as far as battlecruisers are concerned, my sister and I are the best, so sir, your vision is really good~ hehe~"
 Gneisenau_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sir, did you see it? My sister was very excited after fighting with the Duke of York... I haven't seen my sister so passionate for a long time. Perhaps this is the truest side of my sister."
 Gneisenau_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Country E people always boast that their defenses are not leaking, but in my opinion, it is really full of loopholes...Sir, do you think I am too powerful?"
 Gneisenau_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hehe, sir, remember to look at my sister for me, tell me when I wake up, I will decorate her turret, hehe~"
 Gneisenau_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "People in country G never care about the exquisiteness of the food, just like this plate of grilled sausages...Although they are grilled black and a bit hard, they can also be nourished! Eat it!"
 Taihou_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hey, don’t you need to train today? Then I’ll go to school, but before that... I’m going to buy some snacks, hehe, do you want to be together?"
 Taihou_TouchDialog_2:0 "Thick armor can protect me better, but on the other hand it also makes me feel weak..."
 Taihou_TouchDialog_3:0 "Try to make some spells to protect everyone... Oh... I forgot what the spell is, I need to check..."
 Taihou_TouchDialog_4:0 "I'm hungry... Admiral, I, I want to eat dumplings... (softly)"
 Taihou_TouchDialog_5:0 "Another day has passed. Happy people are all similar. My happiness... is so small compared to them."
 Taihou_TouchDialog_6:0 "I always feel that there is something faintly in the water, is it my illusion? ... Huh, it seems too tired, it's time to rest."
 Taihou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ah...it hurts-admiral why did you knock on my head again, is it fun?! Lower your head and let me knock on it too to forgive you~"
 Taihou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ah, admiral, what's the matter...to eat together? It's great, then I will wait for you to come to me after I finish training every day."
 Taihou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Well-this book is very well written...hee hee, do you want to read it too? Then...hey! (jumps into your arms) let's read it together!"
 Taihou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Vaguely thundering, hazy sky, but hope that the wind and rain will keep you here... Admiral, is this a beautiful word?"
 Taihou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "(Whispering) I'm a little hungry... Ah, admiral, is this for me? Really? Thank you!"
 Taihou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh-isn't it just reading a ghost story? I, I will not be afraid! I am no longer...Ah! Who, who turned off the lights!!"
 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_1:0 "Everyone gives me serious training! Hmm? Sir, you are no exception~"
 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_2:0 "Even destroyers must be trained well in artillery, even battleships must have lightning strike capability, speed is also essential... well, this is the overall development."
 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_3:0 "Even if I am fighting a cruiser head-on, I am confident that I will not let go."
  GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_4:0 "The enemies I run into, I will definitely make them feel the sorrow of being weak, hehe~"
 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_5:0 "PO-101...Huh? Did I say something strange? Maybe it's too tired."
 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_6:0 "If there are destroyers and cruisers who do not know the heights of the earth and want to attack me, I will use 20mm cannon to punish them, hehe"
 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The little girl named Harrier Eagle in I country is still so unconfident. She obviously took the strongest equipment I gave. How can she be so weak? If I have a chance, I must educate her!"
 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Sir, are you the kind of person who can only move forward by hitting?... Hee hee, don't worry, it won't hurt too much, I'll try it~"
 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hindenburg, don't do things so impulsively. Although you are really strong, you can't always fight with others. Don't you... Sit down and let sister see if you are hurt..."
 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Today's training is really terrible... The guys in Country S don't know what it means to respect the predecessors... Hey, don't move, it hurts here..."
 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Study children are always extra cute, don't you think, sir~ hee hee, what do you want me to teach you today?"
 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh-those guys always laugh at me, wait, I will prove that my design is perfect..."
 ArkRoyal_TouchDialog_1:0 "Never stop, never get tired, never give in. This is our eternal pride."
 ArkRoyal_TouchDialog_2:0 "History will put the winners in the annals of history, and I am the writer of history."
 ArkRoyal_TouchDialog_3:0 "Even in the face of great difficulties, we must never give up."
 ArkRoyal_TouchDialog_4:0 "The younger generations are better than me. It's really something to be happy about."
 ArkRoyal_TouchDialog_5:0 "Darkness will always pass. Although it is a very simple truth, many people can't do it."
 ArkRoyal_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, if you have time, please pay more attention to glory, the child is always a little unconfident."
 ArkRoyal_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Just leave the anti-submarine task to the younger generation. I only need to give the enemy a fatal blow when it is critical~!"
 ArkRoyal_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Swordfish, this little guy can always surprise me...Huh? Have you found Bismarck? Hehe, it seems that this exercise can be successfully won again."
 ArkRoyal_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The black tea made by Miss Hood is really delicious. Would you like a cup?"
 ArkRoyal_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Always indulging in regret for what you have done in the past is not a wise move. Fighting for different interests and working together for the same purpose is just the most common thing in history."
 ArkRoyal_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "In this endless battle, you must not lose yourself... Victory is important, but if you forget why you fight, then everything will be meaningless."
 ArkRoyal_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "How can they make black tea, only me... alas, it seems that they can only learn from the beginning..."
 Yorktown_TouchDialog_1:0 "Both sisters are much better than me. It's really happy... I can't slack off!"
  Yorktown_TouchDialog_2:0 "No matter how many ups and downs you go through, you can't give up hope. After darkness is light, just like the great battle from which my name comes from."
 Yorktown_TouchDialog_3:0 "Commander, you have worked hard! Huh? Is my haircut cute? Thank you, hehe"
 Yorktown_TouchDialog_4:0 "Take a rest? Thank you...but, no need at all. Now there are more important things waiting for me to do. If the Commander is tired, please rest first."
 Yorktown_TouchDialog_5:0 "Well the company... Although she is very strong, when will she grow up? Maybe it depends on you, Commander."
 Yorktown_TouchDialog_6:0 "Lexington is really a trustworthy predecessor. It's a joy to act with her."
 Yorktown_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Will your hair be messy?...Don't perfuse me, even if you don't care, you will be laughed at when you are seen."
 Yorktown_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I gained weight recently? It must be your illusion, and don't you think it's rude to speak like this?"
 Yorktown_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Oh... the company is going to provoke the Lexington sisters again. It's unfair to hit two by three, and it won't be fun to win... Well? There are three of them? How could it be possible!"
 Yorktown_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Commander, come here and try my burger! Specially made in Yorktown with a lot of ingredients! It's just a bit spicy...Hey, you, how are you?"
 Yorktown_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Let me see what else is in the kitchen...cheese, bread, beef patty...hehe, it's my favorite combination!"
 Yorktown_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Bumblebee, Bumblebee... Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, I won't steal your little one... By the way, do you want to go for a run together?"
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_1:0 "When can I have another problem-solving exercise with the predecessors? Then the lively scene should be difficult to see in the future."
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_2:0 "I don't know who the two Lexington-class sisters and our three York City sisters are better?"
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_3:0 "When will I have a chance to prove my strength? If enemies attack, I will make them regret it."
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_4:0 "Think about it, there are so many powerful sisters who dare to invade the port area. It's really brave enough to be a little ridiculous."
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_5:0 "Miss Nanda has protected me several times in distress, and I am really grateful to her. How can I repay her? Hmm..."
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_6:0 "I haven't finished my work so late, hum~ You still need my special guidance from the enterprise~"
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_oathed_1: 0 "Commander, I'm going to train oh ...... Well ah - you seem to not care how like, do not want to see me shine and gorgeous brilliant performance because it ah I will complete perfectly?? So don't worry? Ah...heh. When...Of course, I can't go wrong. Leave it to me!"
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Please stay by my side even when fighting, I will protect you... well... yes, this is the farthest distance you can leave me... come, hold my hand Oh! "
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Today's enterprise account is also worthy of the number one!...Huh? What did you say? What? You didn't see it? It seems that it will make you suffer."
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "HiCommander! Where are you going? The beach is very dangerous... Hmm... Well, you can also accompany you. You have to follow me obediently, hum~"
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "If these files...I can handle them too, really! Leave them to me...Ah, so many-hey, Commander, I'm a little tired, so I'll go to rest first. Bye~"
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Commander, commander-oh, are you asleep?... Hey, I didn’t expect to sleep so hard, but it’s a bit cute. Sleep well~ just leave the rest to me~"
 Ryuujou_TouchDialog_1:0 "Huh! This jewelry box is so cute! We really like it! Ahem... Your lord Admiral?"
 Ryuujou_TouchDialog_2:0 "If anyone is lazy paddling on the way to training, he will suffer the consequences when he arrives on the battlefield."
 Ryuujou_TouchDialog_3:0 "The Lexington hat...looks very handsome, I want one too."
 Ryuujou_TouchDialog_4:0 "If you can eat oden at this time, let's have another cup... Let's just talk for fun! We are on duty!"
 Ryuujou_TouchDialog_5:0 "Eh! All said, this footnote should be like this... Hey! You are making mistakes while talking!? Is your elm head under repair? Stop! Let's talk about it! It should be like this here Remember it for us!!"
 Ryuujou_TouchDialog_6:0 "0"
  Ryuujou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey...we also want a powerful carrier-based aircraft! It's rare to participate in this kind of competition, and we don't want to be eliminated in the first round... Now, we can only find a doctor!"
 Ryuujou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Learning is about gradual and orderly progress, but there is no way to get to the sky in one step. Try to find some shortcuts to walk, and don't cry out if you fall!"
 Ryuujou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "What are you thinking about? We are not the stove! If you stare at us unkindly, we are going to get angry! Oh! Take the kettle down! We can't spare you!!!"
 Ryuujou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Forcibly expanding the hangar will make it shorter...Why didn't anyone tell us in advance! Besides, what a side effect is this? It's bullying no matter how you look at it!"
 Ryuujou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The Saratoga guy has been guarding us... We just want to borrow a hat to wear it on. Really, let someone explain it..."
 Ryuujou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Are you pointing to us to praise you? Unfortunately, even if you are now, you are still far from the ideal image in our minds!"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_1:0 "Gui'an, Your Excellency Commander. Is there anything to be happy about? Speak up and listen."
 Bogue_TouchDialog_2:0 "How can I get the chaser to call my sister? Oh...that kid is too stubborn!"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_3:0 "It is my job to provide air support to the fleet. Although it is not as good as the predecessors, I will try my best to do my best!"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_4:0 "Uh... it's dark, it doesn't always feel good... there should be nothing wrong, right?"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_5:0 "...Why can't I express my thoughts frankly, chaser...As a sister, I must do something to change this situation!"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_6:0 "Work belongs to work, although I also want to help you...but this is not what I do."
 Bogue_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Your Excellency Commander~Please teach me how to make a person show your heart! Ah? I think you must be very good at this kind of things, so I came to you~Trouble you, I will benefit you!"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Um, you speak slowly, let me write it down... Oh, is that so? What a superb skill! As expected, your commander! Thank you very much~ I'm leaving now!"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Success~ It's great to see the boy blushing! Come on~ the benefits mentioned before~ how about it, the U-boat biscuits I made by myself~ are they cute?"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "What is the romantic thing~ What is it? How can it be called "romantic"? Do you know-huh? Suddenly holding my hand for what? Ah! I see, this is "romantic" Right!...It feels really good."
 Bogue_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Looking at the little guys running around on the beach, I want to make the carrier-based aircraft fly into the air...Ah! It's still going to sea! I, I, I, I, I can’t control it anymore!"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh...? Why am I here? Did I just faint? I remember I saw those kids and then...? Forget it, don't worry about that much. Commander, do you need help?"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_1:0 "Don't underestimate me, there are so many things I can do!"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_2:0 "Not as good as the predecessors? You, you, you, you...unreasonable to make trouble! I still have room to grow, wait and see!"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_3:0 "Borg! You are here too! Great, it's great to have familiar friends~"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_4:0 "Can't take off the carrier-based aircraft at night, don't expect me to provide any help?"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_5:0 "I know to stay with the seniors all day long, huh! I must surpass them to show you this commander!"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_6:0 "Clerk, clerical! Hurry up and get rid of these! These are all things that belong to you, Commander!"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Well...that, can you stare at someone else? I won't run away, there is no need to stare so tightly...Ah! Don't lean over! Ah! Really, why are you so clingy!"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "No...not to say that I hate it, but I am also an adult, and you are still the chief of the port area, you must pay attention to etiquette...oh...no...what am I trying to say...don't look at me Face!!"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Borg. She always wants me to call her "sister". Really, does she care about the verbal title? In my heart, she has always been my sister. Ah, don't you tell her what I just said It would be embarrassing!"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Why do you want someone to coax you to sleep...Are you still a kid?! Huh? Even if you praise me so much...I won't...cough cough, then I will start, "A long, long time ago--""
 Chaser_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "If someone helps, these pieces of paper can be solved faster, right? Then... if you need me... just say it! Hmm! That's it!"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "What a coquettish child... You are not like a sister at all? How can a sister cry in her arms... Okay, get up! Wipe your tears away! Well, my sister is so good. Oh~"
 Colossus_TouchDialog_1:0 "The predecessors are so good, so I don't seem to need to do much anymore~"
  Colossus_TouchDialog_2:0 "Take off, Firefly--! Hey, Firefly, why are you looking at me like that... It's not that you misunderstood!"
 Colossus_TouchDialog_3:0 "This mission...to go to such a far place again, I feel a little bit reluctant to commander..."
 Colossus_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, can you teach me this...how to do this paperwork? After I learn it, I can help you!"
 Colossus_TouchDialog_5:0 "There are so many stars in the sky tonight, so beautiful... Commander, can I, can I lean on your shoulders?"
 Colossus_TouchDialog_6:0 "If I were a regular aircraft carrier, I would be able to help you more..."
 Colossus_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "(Stretching) I’m so tired, I don’t want to get up... Why don’t you just go lazily for a day? Don’t worry, Commander, if you don’t say anything, no one will care about it~ hee hee~"
 Colossus_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I heard that it was General Richelieu who performed the task together today. I heard that she is very strict with her subordinates... I hope that nothing goes wrong, I'm so scared..."
 Colossus_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Firefly strikes! Hey, Firefly, it's not called you, but...Oh, it's called you to take off. Firefly...Ah, what a mess! Who gave so many repeated names!"
 Colossus_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "If there is a vacation time, can you take me to Hong Kong to play? Shanghai is also fine."
 Colossus_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Although I was very nervous throughout the mission, I did not expect that I performed well, and I was praised by General Richelieu! Hey, I can do as good as the predecessors as long as I work hard~"
 Colossus_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Commander, can you accompany me next time in ocean warfare? It's so boring to be alone..."
 Princeton_TouchDialog_1:0 "Senior Saratoga played really well, and I will continue to work hard!"
 Princeton_TouchDialog_2:0 "Try to do every training and try to catch up with the seniors."
 Princeton_TouchDialog_3:0 "Commander, I invented a new magic. Would you like to see it?"
 Princeton_TouchDialog_4:0 "Every time I see the Cleveland sisters, there is always a mysterious intimacy..."
 Princeton_TouchDialog_5:0 "Magic, start~!...Hey, the combat capability is still not satisfactory..."
 Princeton_TouchDialog_6:0 "I heard that there is a predecessor of a light aircraft carrier fighting bravely in the Atlantic. I really want to learn from her combat experience."
 Princeton_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Quickly, close your eyes...Come, I will help you to the table...Dangdangdang! This is not magic! It took Miss Princeton three hours to make it today!"
 Princeton_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hey! Let the battlefield magician teach you how to perform gorgeously on the battlefield today!... (lowly) Hey, the commander is watching, hehe, great..."
 Princeton_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Senior Saratoga! Where are you going? Take me there, okay?... Hey, Commander, don't look at me with that pitiful look. Shall we go out with her?"
 Princeton_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "If there is a magic that can make me invisible on the battlefield at any time, it will be fine, so that I don't have to be afraid of the enemy attacking me~"
 Princeton_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander~Commander! Do you want to complete the work in an instant? I have a good way, look at my magic, change!... Hey! Hey... If all the files are changed, it is equal to completion. That's it, haha...I, I'm leaving now..."
 Princeton_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Hey? You want me to perform yesterday's magic once again... This is not good, because it violates the Three Principles of Saston! Hey, but I have prepared a new magic for you!"
 Unicorn_TouchDialog_1:0 "In addition to training and combat, aircraft maintenance and care work is also necessary, but the aircraft carrier ladies are working hard every day. Leave this to me."
 Unicorn_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sister Prestige is really cool and handsome when fighting. I am afraid that only the calm and steady Queen Elizabeth can match her..."
 Unicorn_TouchDialog_3:0 "Does the commander like my performance? But work hard first~"
 Unicorn_TouchDialog_4:0 "Is the commander tired after a day of work? Let me play a song for you to soothe your spirit and hope to relieve your fatigue."
 Unicorn_TouchDialog_5:0 "It is the happiest thing for unicorns to be able to help everyone in their daily lives."
 Unicorn_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, actually... In fact, the unicorn has a secret garden that belongs only to him~ If you can, would you like to see it?"
 Unicorn_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Song, did you wake you up?...Next time I will call you with a softer song, hehe..."
 Unicorn_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Shhhh
 Unicorn_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I'm going to take care of the garden today. Do you want to be together? You help me take care of it together, and I will play the piano for you."
 Unicorn_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Belfast...If you have the opportunity, can you please help me to make an appointment with her? I think it seems that if we play in ensemble, it will be more effective... The legion seems to be good too."
 Unicorn_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Ladies of aircraft carriers always feel relieved to hand over the aircraft to me for repairs. Although I am not very good at fighting, this kind of work happens to be suitable for me. After all... isn't the purpose of fighting itself for protection? "
 Unicorn_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "How are you feeling today? This determines what style of music I will play for you tonight."
 Deutschland_TouchDialog_1:0 "What a "pocket battleship", please call me "Panzerschiffe"! Sir, do you not speak German?"
 Deutschland_TouchDialog_2:0 "The endurance of a diesel engine is not comparable to that of a rotten iron spray with steam! Take advantage of the high speed, let those slow "iron turtles" look at me!"
 Deutschland_TouchDialog_3:0 "Training is over~ Have another beer~ Phew! What could be more exciting than this!"
 Deutschland_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hey, exciting night! Who will be the unlucky tonight~ Ahem, I didn’t say anything! Sir!"
 Deutschland_TouchDialog_5:0 "Schel~What are you doing here? Wow! I told you not to use the torpedo as a cigar! Throw it away!"
 Deutschland_TouchDialog_6:0 "What time is it now? Sir, why are you still standing here? Go and rest. Leave these written documents to me! What! Your worried look!?"

 AdmiralScheer_TouchDialog_2:0 "Hey, sir, do you want a cigar too? It tastes more than ten times better than ordinary tobacco! Ah, I have a torpedo in my hand~ I am on duty now."
 AdmiralScheer_TouchDialog_3:0 "Cigar is also good with beer~ Huhuhu, the sir must have never tried it. I haven't told anyone about this combination yet, you are the first one~"
 AdmiralScheer_TouchDialog_4:0 "Ha...ha...it's finally night, hurry up and get a cigar-huh~ refreshing, wait, how come there is a smell of paint?"
 AdmiralScheer_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sir? Sir? It seems to be asleep~ Hey, let me go to the wine cellar to see what is there~"

 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_3:0 "Those who have lost their sense of resistance have nothing to do with this war. Isn't it something we should do to extend a helping hand to the victims?"
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_4:0 "On beer alone, I think Franz is better. Of course, excessive drinking will paralyze the senses. What is needed on the battlefield are elite soldiers, not foul drunks."
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_5:0 "Huh? Are these... tears? Don't worry about me, sir. I just thought of someone. I... didn't waver."
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_6:0 "The more files pile up, this is not a good thing, it just exposes the fact that you are inefficient in doing things."
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Discovering the shortcomings of soldiers and correcting them is one of the duties of a commander. If I have any shortcomings, please let me know."
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "In a limited time, people can give birth to infinite possibilities. Choose the most suitable one from the infinite, and use this as the goal, you will not have regrets in this life... Sadness? Maybe yes, how long can I be with you?"
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Do you want to learn some German? Well, it is difficult to understand. But everything has a process, and I will bear the pain and tears with you."
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Will the night sky here be the same as that in the port? I have never seen the night sky there. Perhaps it is a lifetime regret... I want to go back there again, bathed in the stars..."
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "As long as it is what you ordered, there is nothing I can't do. I am the sharpest blade under your hand, and those who block the way will be broken into pieces."
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Death is the end... I'm sorry to say these disappointing words. At night, people will think wildly, even me. No matter how strong I am, I am an ordinary person..."
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_1:0 "Admiral Admiral~ Need help? It doesn't matter what it is! I'm eager to try!"
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sister always can't distinguish some things. For example, salt and sugar, matcha powder and mustard...Wow, it feels terrible to think about it."
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_3:0 "Good visibility! Perfect wind direction! Hmm, let's fly a kite!"
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_4:0 "Ah...it's night, so I can't move around now...patrol missions! You can move around again! Awesome!"
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_5:0 "1922...1926...1937...Wow! Admiral! Don't show up suddenly! Now I have to count again!"
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_6:0 "Ah-the paperwork is so boring. I really want to hurry up to the morning... eh eh eh?! I have to do it all?! How can there be such a..."
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Who told you that what I said was pretentious? Wait, don't say it, let me guess...it must be that girl! Look, I guessed it! Stinky girl, I have to be good Teach her!"
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "You open the door for me! What are you doing hiding in it! You give-huh? The door is unlocked... Wow!
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hey, did you see that stinky girl? Who is making a cake!? Tell me where she is! I'm going to burn her seaweed head straight!!"
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It took me a lot of time to wash off this flour...Huh? That girl has been tied to a chair by me. I have been hungry for a day. I will dare to commit the crime after I see her!"
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The Doctor's laboratory is brightly lit every night. Doesn't she never rest at all? It's terrible, but I just can't hold on."
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "That's it, it's time for you to rest. May the moonlight guide you into your sweet dreamland~ This is not a gesture!"
 Kako_TouchDialog_1:0 "Admiral, good morning. You look very energetic~ It would be nice to keep it going, hehe~"
 Kako_TouchDialog_2:0 "Good afternoon~ Would you like a cup of black tea-yeah, I almost splashed it on my body. I forgot to say it was made by the older sister~"
  Kako_TouchDialog_3:0 "Well... these annoying seagulls, go away!"
 Kako_TouchDialog_4:0 "Ah, what's wrong with you? I made this snack by myself? Don't be so scared~"
 Kako_TouchDialog_5:0 "Should I handle the paperwork for you? Don't be so cautious~ I won't do unnecessary things~"

 Aoba_TouchDialog_3:0 "The shelling action is too slow! Don't hesitate after aiming, the opportunity is fleeting!"
 Aoba_TouchDialog_4:0 "I'm not very good at using props like searchlights. It's really, quite troublesome..."
 Aoba_TouchDialog_5:0 "Can't you fall asleep? Rest is necessary if the official duties are completed. Otherwise, shall I sing a sleeping song for you?... Hee hee, I am very good at it~!"
 Aoba_TouchDialog_6:0 "Hey, the special driver in front! It's past the access time. Fuxue! Take my sisters back soon!"
 Aoba_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "What can I do...Oh oh, Admiral! You came just right. Do you have any suggestions for lunch? I won't be mistaken for the seasoning this time. Don't worry, it's for you after all prepare."
 Aoba_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Salt Salt...This is...hmm...? It should be right? Well, it should be right. Just follow your instincts and think so much. This time, you will never fail!"
 Aoba_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It's not a good habit to speak bad things secretly... What were you muttering just now? Let me listen to it. Huh? What's the matter, you look very nervous. Hurry up and listen. "
 Aoba_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "How is it, what I said is right?... Hee hee, today, do you remember what day it is today? You will be punished if you answer wrongly!"
 Aoba_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Yes, please just refuse it here. You don't need to circumvent unnecessary places, the options are only "yes" or "no". Cough...for example...after work, you can go to the beach with me Is it? "Yes"? "No"?"
 Aoba_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Alcohol numbs the senses and is a deadly poison for soldiers. However, it is not a bad thing to celebrate with your colleagues after a toast."
 Kinugasa_TouchDialog_1:0 "Admiral~ Today is also a peaceful day~ Peace, I really want to keep it."
 Kinugasa_TouchDialog_2:0 "It's too silly to be too entangled in seniority, as long as it can come in handy."
 Kinugasa_TouchDialog_3:0 "Wow...Is this a black tiger prawn? No need, I hate things with shells."
 Kinugasa_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sister's training cannot tolerate the slightest sloppy... She is really a "devil" in this respect..."
 Kinugasa_TouchDialog_5:0 "Speaking of singing, the eldest sister is first-rate. How about? Isn't it a bit unexpected~"

 London_TouchDialog_4:0 "Star River will not get tired for as long as you watch it. Well, "Looking Up at the Starry Sky" Pie, I want to try it. Commander, can I help you try it? This is a native British cuisine~"
 London_TouchDialog_5:0 "Um... the ingredients always feel wrong? Sure enough, there are differences between the crops grown in different places."

 Kent_TouchDialog_3:0 "If it is a torpedo, I have the confidence to avoid it all. Humph, I also have the advantages! No...no laugh!"
 Kent_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's night~ I won't be afraid! It's not a kid anymore... ahhhhh?
 Kent_TouchDialog_5:0 "I really want to change it soon... this way, the problem of poor armor protection can be improved. I always feel... it won't be that simple..."
 Kent_TouchDialog_6:0 "Paperwork? Yes! Please let me participate! As long as you don’t stay outside..."
 Kent_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "These sweet words...you have already said to other girls, right? That's why you are so proficient...I, of course I will be jealous! I am also a girl! Oh...I don't care! You have to explain clearly today That's fine!"
 Kent_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Will wearing more clothes increase the armor value... Wow, that's too stupid... I'm thinking of something messy. It's all on you! Don't look at me! You can't take a peek! Close your eyes!"
 Kent_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Intimate people... Except for Suffolk, there should be only you, right? What, what is your sudden arrogance! It is your blessing to be my lover! Don't hurry up and thank me!"
 Kent_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Big tiger, yelling  um~ I'll cut your nails, lie down obediently. Um... the touch of this meat ball is really - too, too wonderful!"
 Kent_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The look in your eyes...isn’t it that you want to fix me again? Ah, isn’t it? What are you here forgift? Well, then I’ll just accept it...you, you occasionally Not bad!"
 Kent_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It's time for rest, you can go back to your room and rest after sorting the files~ The rest will be dealt with tomorrow, I will help by then, as a gift in return~"
 Portland_TouchDialog_1:0 ""The plan can't keep up with the changes", this sentence is sympathetic to me."
  Portland_TouchDialog_2:0 "Is it a defect... I really can't see it. If I can be stronger, my sisters will be able to see the beauty of this world..."
 Portland_TouchDialog_3:0 "Never show sorrow, Indy is such a child. As a sister... Am I a little dereliction of duty?"
 Portland_TouchDialog_4:0 "What can I do to change the status quo... I know, I always know. But... what should I do? Indy... "
 Portland_TouchDialog_5:0 "Commander! Sorry... I've been distracted before. I really am a flawed person..."
 Portland_TouchDialog_6:0 "This is the file you assigned to me. It has been completed. Only with this, I am confident that I will never make a mistake."
 Portland_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Indy's child, she always loses everything in her work. No matter how she is judged, she doesn't mean to repent at all. "Let's go with the flow" is not necessarily all right... "
 Portland_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I like country music better. Listening to the familiar melody is like returning to my hometown. If you are also interested, I can lend you a few records. But you must keep it safe!"
 Portland_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "If Miss Lexington and Miss Saratoga both wear the same clothes and do not speak, it is still somewhat indistinguishable. But it is very simple for me, but I often escort them! "
 Portland_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Wow! It's not?! I didn't expect you to have such a rare phonograph in your collection! In order to be worthy of it, I will come up with the most precious record!"
 Portland_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "What did you bring backsquirrel? Indy...Are you a druid? How can these little guys listen to you so much..."
 Portland_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Tonight is so satisfying! Sure enough, "a good horse needs a good saddle"-right? Anyway, if there is a good record in the future, I beg you~"
 Indianapolis_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hello, Commander~ If you don't mind, just call me "Indi"~"
 Indianapolis_TouchDialog_2:0 "Transportation missions sometimes have to be treated as attack missions. This is a talk of experience."
 Indianapolis_TouchDialog_3:0 "Where is Miss Lucy now? I really want to share this honor with her."
 Indianapolis_TouchDialog_4:0 "Don't be careless at any time. The enemy may have been waiting for the moment when we relax our vigilance."
 Indianapolis_TouchDialog_5:0 "Don't always look curious, this is not a toy that can be played casually. Do you understand, Commander?"
 Indianapolis_TouchDialog_6:0 "The sea is very calm. "Peace" is really great..."
 Indianapolis_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Yeah~Commander! Do you want to see my beast buddy? Silverbolthaha, the landing position is just right, I will reward you with a piece of dried meat~"
 Indianapolis_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Don't think it is very close to me. If outsiders dare to touch it like this, a piece of meat will definitely be pecked off. It hurts to think about it, right~ So take your hand back quickly."
 Indianapolis_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "If the torpedo is traceable, it shouldn't be difficult to hit it? Maybe you can use a lasso to tie it up~ Try it next time!"
 Indianapolis_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Cheetor~You are here. Come on, dinner today. You didn't go out to scare those kittens, did you? Haha, don't go too far, those little ones are so courageous."
 Indianapolis_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huh? Where's my bottles? Sister-don't take them! They have many uses! For example...for example, if the house leaks-hey, wait a minute!!!"
 Indianapolis_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I was told by my sister that "I can't figure out the situation"...Everyone is a close friend, and it doesn't matter if you live together? And Cheetor is still very soft and... I really don't understand my sister's thoughts."
 Pensacola_TouchDialog_1:0 "Unlimited firepower -! Only offense is the best defense!"

 Pensacola_TouchDialog_3:0 "Commander, is there another transportation task? Just leave it to me, rest assured, I will deliver the supplies safely!"
 Pensacola_TouchDialog_4:0 "Although the rose is beautiful, it is easy to wither. Only the ghost wandering on the sea can truly scare the enemy."
 Pensacola_TouchDialog_5:0 "If the commander has time to accompany Northampton, she has been working hard since that happened. She must be very tired... For me, don’t worry, I don’t have one. She is so fragile!"
 Pensacola_TouchDialog_6:0 "If the weak point of the enemy's defense can be found, it will be easier to surprise the enemy."
 Pensacola_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Commander, is there any way you can get Salt Lake City to refresh yourself? She always looks absent-minded and sad..."
 Pensacola_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Get up~ Commander, my first task today is to escort you to the office. Do you want to be dragged by me to the office in pajamas or do you want to change your clothes?"
 Pensacola_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "You are not allowed to prescribe a certain nickname before me. Only the enemy will call me that. I don't allow you to say it."
 Pensacola_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Let’s call Salt Lake City for dinner today, although I hope to be alone with you, but after all, I can’t leave her alone..."
 Pensacola_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "You should also hate roses? The thing that grows thorns recklessly because of its beauty is the most annoying..."
 Pensacola_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "In the quiet night, although there are many murderous intents hidden, don't be afraid~! Because I am by your side. Hehe, I am very reliable!"
 SaltLakeCity_TouchDialog_1:0 "Although clerical work makes my back uncomfortable, it unexpectedly suits me..."
 SaltLakeCity_TouchDialog_2:0 "Training, I really can't help it...Can you call San Francisco with me?"
 SaltLakeCity_TouchDialog_3:0 "Although Pensacola and I are not very strong, but luck is unexpectedly good, I have to say that this ability is pretty good..."
 SaltLakeCity_TouchDialog_4:0 "Alas, I have to repair the armor every day after training. It's a waste of time..."
 SaltLakeCity_TouchDialog_5:0 "Pensacola says energetically every day, really...what? I'm going to play against Northampton tomorrow? This...fortunately it's not with Maya."

 Northampton_TouchDialog_3:0 "You seem to have a problem? Do you need my help?"
 Northampton_TouchDialog_4:0 "Miss Enterprise can always bring me a lot of good luck~"
 Northampton_TouchDialog_5:0 "Is there anything wrong with Miss Bumblebee calling me out?...Hey, are these snacks for me? Thank you!"
 Northampton_TouchDialog_6:0 "It's a bit tired from being so busy every day, but it's also full of fun."
 Northampton_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Although it is on duty, but it is too sleepy...Lend your leg to me for ten minutes, ten minutes, remember to call me~!"
 Northampton_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The relationship between the sisters at the York City level is so close, and I really want to get together with sisters at the same level... Commander, can you help me figure out a solution?"
 Northampton_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Oh, it's rare to have a leisure time today, Commander, do you have any arrangements? Hee hee~"
 Northampton_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Commander, have I progressed recently? ...how much progress has been made? ...huh, you know you are perfunctory by hearing it!"
 Northampton_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huh-finally back, how about you, Commander? Haha, today is a good efficiency, let's go for a walk together... just the two of us."
 Northampton_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "In order to end the nasty war sooner, I have to work harder, Commander, you have to work hard too!"
 Houston_TouchDialog_1:0 "Do you have a task? Leave it to me. It will be completed smoothly."
 Houston_TouchDialog_2:0 "There are so many unknown enemies in the depths of the sea, it makes people feel excited to think about it."
 Houston_TouchDialog_3:0 "I will not be afraid of any battle, nor will I be afraid of failure. These are manifestations of the weak."
 Houston_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's been a long time since I saw De Ruiter. I don't know how that kid is doing..."
 Houston_TouchDialog_5:0 "No matter when, the commander always feels very busy, saying that occasionally I find a place with a nice view, and I rarely have the opportunity to make an appointment with the commander."

 Kirov_TouchDialog_3:0 "I don't have any results worth mentioning? Yes, it would be great to survive that war!"

 Kirov_TouchDialog_5:0 "Look, there are stars. Comrades, come and watch the stars together!"
 Kirov_TouchDialog_6:0 "In order to deal with the drill tomorrow morning, comrades, please rest quickly."

 Sendai_TouchDialog_6:0 "I have a sister who is a little headache. Although she is very strong, she is a little bit "bad" in teaching people..."
 Sendai_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The little girl Naka always told me that I was worried about too many things, and I didn't want to be like that. The burden on my shoulders was heavier than I thought...Oh, I'm talking frustrated again, you can't let those Children hear..."
 Sendai_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Special hobby? Why did you suddenly remember to ask this? Ah, that's too much! Natto is not a strange thing! Its nutritional value is"
 Sendai_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Although lying is not good, sometimes it is a means to make things go smoothly. It makes people love and hate..."
 Sendai_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The third mine team is composed of special destroyers. Each attack is like going to a parent-child outing. Of course, it's just a description. The battle is not a trifle."
 Sendai_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Weird...Where did the natto box go? I remember it should beHuh? Why are you lying on the ground, Naka? Ah, I found it! It was here~"
 Sendai_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Are you hungry? Then I will leave for a while and prepare some light food for you. Don't worry, I won't add natto in. Really...everyone is like this, I can’t understand natto. The beauty..."
 Jintsuu_TouchDialog_1:0 "No matter what the battle is, it's not for this port area in the end! Everyone is working hard, that's fine! By the way, I prefer the feeling of fighting!"
 Jintsuu_TouchDialog_2:0 "Is this your full power? It's too early! Give me the spirit to take it seriously! The attitude of passing the test is not working for me! Our "Second Mine Team" does not need incompetent people !"
 Jintsuu_TouchDialog_3:0 "Training is over! Huh, it's finally getting better. Next is free time, but don't run too far! Oh~ Kuroshio, what are you doing with your face? I need an instructor to make it for you Relax with a full body massage? Hey! Don't run!"
 Jintsuu_TouchDialog_4:0 "Woo...it’s a headache...ah! Admiral! You came just right! Do you need a supper? I remember you didn’t have a meal, right! Hahaha, the older sister made it, so eat it with confidence. Natto Yo~Natto~"
 Jintsuu_TouchDialog_5:0 "It's so late and there are people training in the drill field. It's really admirable! If it weren't for the official business, I really want to go in and watch it! Okay! Speed ​​up!"
  Jintsuu_TouchDialog_6:0 "Oh? Some people say that I am a "devil"? Hahaha, how could that be possible! Wait...it must be those little ghosts who are changing the law to harm me! I can't even accept this level of training , But you are not qualified to say that you are a member of the "Second Mine Team"!"
 Jintsuu_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Love words or something, don't expect me to say it. Ha, since you have already signed the vows, you are still struggling with those meaningless things~ It is not boring to rely on love words to maintain feelings. "
 Jintsuu_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Is the frequency of recent expeditions a bit high? Could it be that you have done something willful? Can't you squander the resources brought back by the children like this, do you really understand the meaning of "temperance"?"
 Jintsuu_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "A lot of resources have been stored inadvertently. The amount is really amazing. Looking at these things, I can't help thinking of the incredible efforts that the children have put in. Do this in a way that I can do. Isn’t the effect of the Kata Minato area something to brag about~"
 Jintsuu_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I also know how to cook. Why do you look surprised? Oh, maybe that guy’s unique taste makes you scared, haha! Let’s try what I’ve made. It will never be. Suspicious slimy food~"
 Jintsuu_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Ah, it would be great if she was there, like this-a boring night, her presence can add a lot of fun. Wouldn't you say something? Anything is fine, let's have a chat , Or you will be suffocated...Hello? Did you hear that? Hey!!!"

 Suzutsuki_TouchDialog_5:0 "Head...it hurts...sorry, admiral. For the time being...let me take a break..."
 Suzutsuki_TouchDialog_6:0 "I prepared tea and some snacks...it looks a bit out of date, I hope you don't mind."
 Suzutsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Um...well, I remembered. You...are the admiral. You are the leader who manages this port area. And I, a member of the port area. Naturally, you are also your servant... why, cry What? Mention... Admiral?"
 Suzutsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I'm sorry...there is a defect in function, I...can't understand. Why...is this? You...is the admiral, mine...is mine...is mine, who is it?"
 Suzutsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Are your tears... for me? I... worth your tears? What happened? This ring... is so warmas if, with your body temperature, with your heartbeat. I "
 Suzutsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "You are my admiral. Only mine, admiral. I remember everything. Thank you for your tears, your heartbeat. I will never forget you again, absolutely."
 Suzutsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "If you can, can you help rub my neck? That way, I can calm down. Just being watched by you makes my heart beat faster. Probably...what's wrong again... ..."
 Suzutsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I, know how to make some snacks. It was taught to me by a senior, and it is not a good skill. I still remember her appearance. I must see her again soon, here, again Once... ah, how does it taste? Isn’t it... there is more here, please don’t be polite."
 Kagerou_TouchDialog_1:0 "Call out the names of the tricks when confronting the enemy! This is also the protagonist’s privilege!"
 Kagerou_TouchDialog_2:0 "What kind of posture should I use when shelling? It must be able to highlight the protagonist's temperament!"
 Kagerou_TouchDialog_3:0 "Huh! Now, Lord Ben will be invincibleAh! Shiranui! What do you mean by the look in your eyes!"
 Kagerou_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's finally night! Shiranui won't show up now!"
 Kagerou_TouchDialog_5:0 "In the night I can exert an extraordinary power! Because I am the protagonist, super strong!"
 Kagerou_TouchDialog_6:0 "Admiral, let me help! It is the protagonist's duty to help others!"
 Kagerou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "What are you talking about? Don't leave me the protagonist! Let me join, and I will use the protagonist's power to help you solve problems!"
 Kagerou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Morning~ Admiral! Huh? Is there something stuck behind me? This spell...isn’t it a masterpiece of Shiranui? But the drawing is pretty cute, haha~"
 Kagerou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Um... these guys are pretty good at hiding, I didn't see it until I counted to ten-Kuroshio! Didn't you hide at all?! You respect the game of peekaboo! "
 Kagerou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I found out very early that the kid was avoiding us on purpose, but it must be for us. I am the protagonist, and this level of reasoning ability is not a problem! Shiranui, you laugh again What's the matter!? You have to dismantle my stage every time you get to this kind of handsome session!"
 Kagerou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Speaking of the most powerful destroyer, of course it is our Yangyan type! After all, our nickname is "Type A", which means first class! How? Admiral~ Is my reasoning very clever? Now!"
 Kagerou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The actions that match the decisive line are also something the protagonist must learn! "From here, it is our stage! "Then turn around handsomely and raise his hand! Super~ handsome! Admiral, you can do it again! Hurry up, hurry up~"
 Shiranui_TouchDialog_1:0 "Secretary ship is also a good practice, I will do my best in the future."
 Shiranui_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sister Yang Yan, pay attention to your body balance during shelling. Those flashy movements are useless."
 Shiranui_TouchDialog_3:0 "Admiral, please feel free to give instructions if you need to follow up."
  Shiranui_TouchDialog_4:0 "Isn't this the predecessors of the Five Aviation Wars? It's late at night, what are you doing?"
 Shiranui_TouchDialog_5:0 "Moonlight, stars, and sea breeze, the port area surrounded by this scene is really beautiful."
 Shiranui_TouchDialog_6:0 "Admiral, are you just looking for me? I am always by your side and never leave."
 Shiranui_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 ""I am not only proficient in ninjutsu, but also small in onmyoji. "Why do you show your surprised eyes? Below is just a script for chanting the summer festival performance, don't take it seriously."
 Shiranui_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "This charm is for monitoring... to ensure that Sister Yang Yan’s behavior is absolutely safe. In exchange, they cleaned up their shrine completely. Finally, they also sent the next can of Jinping candies... I feel I owe a favor..."
 Shiranui_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I am very confident about hiding my whereabouts. Although playing peekaboo like this is very bullying, isn't this also a rare and reasonable opportunity to bully? I won't find it. "
 Shiranui_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Shiranui_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Shiranui" is the watcher of the night, and it is the same below. The night is our stage, and we will never allow others to trample on it."
 Shiranui_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Wrist-wrenching can sometimes be regarded as a good pastime. This is how my generation decides who will clean the room the next daythen Kuroshio became the service commissioner."
 Shiranui_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Victory lines and decisive postures will relax one's vigilance. This is undoubtedly an opportunity for the enemy to counterattack. Sister Yang Yan, are you listening carefully? If you pretend to be asleep, you will use Kuwu to go down "
 Kuroshio_TouchDialog_1:0 "Um...what was I thinking just now? Forget it, it's probably not an important thing."
 Kuroshio_TouchDialog_2:0 "What is Kagerou fighting with Shiranui? My sisters are really energetic."
 Kuroshio_TouchDialog_3:0 "Ohhh
 Kuroshio_TouchDialog_4:0 "Huh... or the night is more relaxing. Let's take a tour now."
 Kuroshio_TouchDialog_5:0 "I really want to see Shiranui once... I'm not talking about Shiranui sister, but don't make a mistake."
 Kuroshio_TouchDialog_6:0 "Arashi won't run out of any strange place anymore, right? Don't play pranks or something-wow!"
 Kuroshio_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ah, the noisy guys are gone, it's so good, so good-it would be better if I didn't want me to clean the room. Anyway, we still have to face reality..."
 Kuroshio_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I'm very courageous, don't surprise me with a deliberate surprise. And you Lan! Don't suddenly hug me from behind! Are you trying to cause my cardiac arrest!?"
 Kuroshio_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I originally wanted to raise a hamster, but there are too many cats in the port area...what, can I be allergic to cats? It's not what I want..."
 Kuroshio_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The life I want...Isn't it good now. Don't ask questions like this suddenly, I'll just think about it... Ah, I can't sleep now..."
 Kuroshio_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I told you not to-huh? Today is quite ordinary... Forget it, for your obedient sake, I will treat you to dessert-just today, don't show such expectations The look in his eyes..."
 Kuroshio_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It would be troublesome if you want to become stronger... But if you don't do this, don't you deny the oath? Um... first, go to sleep! Yes! Think about it tomorrow!"
 Yukikaze_TouchDialog_1:0 "If you escort everyone, I have no problem! Should...should..."
 Yukikaze_TouchDialog_2:0 "Too lucky but a little scared, am I causing trouble for everyone..."
 Yukikaze_TouchDialog_3:0 "Tip...Admiral, if you don't mind, this is my snack...please...please accept it!"
 Yukikaze_TouchDialog_4:0 "Night... I can calm down."
 Yukikaze_TouchDialog_5:0 "I really want to be with my sisters... if it doesn't cause trouble... it will be fine..."
  Yukikaze_TouchDialog_6:0 "Admiral...you have worked hard...If I can help too, it won't be delayed so late..."
 Yukikaze_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "For you and everyone, I will work hard to change. From the moment I stepped into this port area...I...have this idea. Now, it is time to look up and face all this."
 Yukikaze_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "If Yukikaze can share his luck with the admiral and everyone...this port area will definitely become more beautiful. Yukikaze... will always be with you, and together turn each other's dreams into reality... ..."
 Yukikaze_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Eh? Snow... Snow wind is not trying to do it, the faith that has been hidden in my heart... It is the admiral that gave me the courage to speak out."
 Yukikaze_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Night...every shining star is a unique landscape. The wish that I once made to the starry sky seems to be in front of my eyes...for the port area under the stars, the snow and wind...the snow wind will work hard to change Be stronger and protect you and everyone... ‌
 Yukikaze_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Um... if you learn to use this, you should be able to help everyone... Ah, mention... Admiral, why are you still here so late... that... do you want to try this? That's... repair... repair tool... "

 Z3_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Senior German, hello. Are you preparing to go to sea? If you can, I want to escort you, and I want to appreciate your heroic posture in the battle again-well, I'm on standby at any time."
 Z3_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "In a blink of an eye, it's night... Be very careful. The way back to the office should be this-ooh... I bumped my head... If Z2 sister is here..."

 Z46_TouchDialog_2:0 "Many sisters have been repeatedly injured in combat due to lack of air-to-air capabilities, but this has also allowed me to accumulate valuable experience. In the future, I will not let tragedies repeat themselves."
 Z46_TouchDialog_3:0 "It is very important to be able to communicate in time on the battlefield...Huh? Sir, I'm not talking to you, I'm just teaching sister Z1 how to use the microphone to convey information and instructions."
 Z46_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sir, this is for you... Hey, this is my self-made communication tool. After wearing it, we can talk at any time as long as we are in the port area. Is it convenient?"
 Z46_TouchDialog_5:0 "This ship's outfit is really perfect! If you want to destroy it, you have to do it before it is designed."
  Z46_TouchDialog_6:0 "I installed invisible microphones on each of my sisters so that I know what they are doing every day... Hey, just to get to know you better."

 Ardent_TouchDialog_3:0 "It's a sunny afternoon. Tianhou held a tea party in her home. Commander, do you want to come together?"
 Ardent_TouchDialog_4:0 "The Queen is really a considerate person. She accidentally broke her clothes while patrolling yesterday, and she helped me make it up."

 Thatcher_TouchDialog_4:0 "Any place where there is discord, as long as Thatcher is there, you can easily solve it~"
 Thatcher_TouchDialog_5:0 "Ahhh, is it already so late? Commander, just play with Thatcher for a little while, just a little while... Hey, you know you are the best!"

 OBannon_TouchDialog_2:0 "When encountering an enemy, in addition to conventional tactics, some unconventional tactics under special circumstances are also needed to scare away the enemy."
 OBannon_TouchDialog_3:0 "Commander, have you come to see my training? Great, Obannon will perform well!"
 OBannon_TouchDialog_4:0 "Lafite is really a brave warrior, and her successors have also inherited her bravery and power perfectly."

 WilliamDPorter_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Willie can also be very serious~! Look, Willie's performance today is not bad, right? Compliment me! I won't be proud!"
 WilliamDPorter_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Commander Commander, today I met a weird little guy. I ran when I saw me. He looked terrified, but in the end he was overtaken by Willie. Hehe, very cute little guy. , Let you see you another day~!"
 WilliamDPorter_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Willie made it for youRoast Beef with Potatoes! Taste it...isn't it delicious? In order to enhance the taste, I specially ordered some corned beef marinated in the Royal Navy, which is said to be very famous... What's wrong with you, Commander?"
 WilliamDPorter_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Actually, it's good to be a clown. It's better than obscurity. Of course, you need a commander who is as tolerant as you."
 Porter_TouchDialog_1:0 "Don't underestimate me! I was designed as a flagship! It was...it was!"
 Porter_TouchDialog_2:0 "Woo... the limelight was all taken away by that guy! Obviously I was the first!"
 Porter_TouchDialog_3:0 "Obviously I was going to rescue others, but in the end I got a seedling...Ahhhhh! I was so ashamed that I was about to die!"
 Porter_TouchDialog_4:0 "At night, people won't be noticed...Ah, why am I so unlucky..."
 Porter_TouchDialog_5:0 "Times are advancing, am I no longer needed? What, it's impossible, right? If I was not needed, I wouldn't be here!"
 Porter_TouchDialog_6:0 "I can do it! Believe in yourself, you will definitely become stronger!"
 Porter_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "In order to be able to protect you, I must become stronger! I will not miss any opportunity to exercise myself!"
 Porter_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "In time, I will definitely become a real "destroyer leader" and lead everyone to victory in every battle!"
 Porter_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Is it weird to be full of longing for the future? I am advancing step by step according to the goals I have set. In fact, I am curious about the unknown future~"
 Porter_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The days when escorting the aircraft carrier ladies are really worthy of cherished memories. They seem to be aloof, and they also have an approachable side."
 Porter_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I used to know nothing, and my mind was full of naive thoughts. But after meeting you, I gradually grew up... I also understand that this feeling that is surging in my heart is for What caused..."
 Porter_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It's so late and I'm pulling you to blow a hair on the beach. I'm sorry... Well, I will see you again tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow morning, you can see a different me. Hehe, do you want to bet? Woolen cloth?"
 Laffey_TouchDialog_1:0 "There is nothing more stupid in the world than burning jade and stone!"
 Laffey_TouchDialog_2:0 "Lafite's training is very hard!"
 Laffey_TouchDialog_3:0 "Lafite is great! Don't underestimate Lafite!"
 Laffey_TouchDialog_4:0 "Laffey has been busy with Commander so late, Commander should be very happy?"
  Laffey_TouchDialog_5:0 "The Commander has become lucky because of Lafite's arrival!"
 Laffey_TouchDialog_6:0 "Lafite has a senior hero who I admire very much. It would be nice if I could see it with my own eyes!"
 Laffey_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "With Lafite by his side, the commander seems to be smiling happily every day!"
 Laffey_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Today's Lafite is also working hard! Run 10 laps around the port area... Me, hey? Let me stop and go to the office, why, why?"
 Laffey_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Lafite has completed today's task ahead of schedule. Does the Commander have any special rewards?"
 Laffey_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Lafite, I met a big tiger tonight! It's not the kind of fierce looking tiger! It's really a big tiger!... I remember Miss Kent was there, Commander, go to the rescue Her!"
 Laffey_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huhthe training is over, I think about what kind of action the senior would make at this time...Well, put your hands on your chest and stand upright...Huh? Why did a figure escape in the distance? Is it...Birui?"
 Laffey_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Now it's just you and me. What should Lafite say at this time? Or...ooh-it's really a headache."
 oldLaffey_TouchDialog_1:0 "I heard that one of my younger generations has an admirer with the same name as me? Interesting, I really want to see her strength and courage, and I hope that my name will not be insulted."
 oldLaffey_TouchDialog_2:0 "Don't be intimidated by the powerful firepower of the battleship. When you really get close to the group of guys, they will be afraid."
 oldLaffey_TouchDialog_3:0 "Only those who believe in their own power in the end will power be with her."
 oldLaffey_TouchDialog_4:0 "Night is always the home ground of destroyers. If an enemy dares to fight with us at this time, it will definitely suffer."
 oldLaffey_TouchDialog_5:0 "As a predecessor, the best thing that can be given to the younger generation is the brave and meaningless combat spirit and the fine tradition of taking the lead. Commander, you are the same."
 oldLaffey_TouchDialog_6:0 "Your Excellency Commander, you have worked hard. Sitting in the office for a long time will also make you unhealthy. How about going out with me to exercise after work?"
 oldLaffey_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Oh? You seem to be full of enthusiasm today. So behave. Although the content and location of your efforts are different, this does not affect the fact that we work together, right?"
 oldLaffey_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "That junior is really a cute guy, but it’s too early to call it a hero...Haha, is it important to be a hero? Even the most ordinary people can do the greatest things, just like you Same."
 oldLaffey_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "(Whispering) I'm a little tired...haha, did you hear it? Then take a break next to you...but you can't tell others, I don't want others to see me so weak."
 oldLaffey_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Don't think that the hero has only a glorious side. Fortunately, you and that child did not bear this heavy responsibility, otherwise, I would feel a little guilty..."
 oldLaffey_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Oh-(stretching) I'm really tired after a day, and only in front of you can I completely relax... Huh-can I get into your arms?"
 oldLaffey_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Hey, Commander, disappear with me for a day... Haha, kidding, but... I really can't remember what it's like to live as an ordinary person. I really want to take a break, even if there is only one day. "
 CamiciaNera_TouchDialog_1:0 "Ahhhh~ sir, please block me, yes, don't let the person named York see me, ohhhh~
 CamiciaNera_TouchDialog_2:0 "Did the sir see Aviere? She can't do without me, I want to find her as soon as possible!"
 CamiciaNera_TouchDialog_3:0 "Compared to combat, I still prefer to stay with you, sir... It’s not for being lazy."
 CamiciaNera_TouchDialog_4:0 "Once, because of my cowardice, Aviere was seriously injured, so I hope that through my own efforts, I can cheer her up again!"
 CamiciaNera_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sir, would you like a cup of coffee I made? Hehe~ This is specially made for you."
 CamiciaNera_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sister Veneto is the most handsome! Sir, do you want to go with me to see if the eldest sister has any dreams?"

 Aviere_TouchDialog_3:0 "Weird... It's obviously the right direction, how come you came back... Camicia... Where did you go..."
 Aviere_TouchDialog_4:0 "Wow, is this the supper you made? Woo...I can't eat it. If I get fat, it will become like before..."
 Aviere_TouchDialog_5:0 "I didn't have much time to sit and read during the day, now I finally have some time. Um... I saw it yesterday..."

 AntoniodaNoli_TouchDialog_3:0 "Sister Veneto is the most handsome! I really want to stay by her side!"
 AntoniodaNoli_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sir, it's hard work~ This is the tea I commissioned by Sister Veneto to make tea, try it!"
 AntoniodaNoli_TouchDialog_5:0 "It's night, can you play with me for a while~"
 AntoniodaNoli_TouchDialog_6:0 "Early to bed and early to rise are good children, and they can grow up healthily!"
 AntoniodaNoli_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey! How come the sir is still sleeping? He is an adult but like a baby. It's... um-then bite your arm to wake up, ah oh-(bite)"
 AntoniodaNoli_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "This scentah! Sir, what delicious meow did you make! Give me the first chance to taste it!"
 AntoniodaNoli_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Ohhh, I got rid of the candy that the officer gave me, but can you give me another one?"
 AntoniodaNoli_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Today, I will accompany you until late at night... I, I am not sleepy... Huhu-the sir's chest is very warm..."
  AntoniodaNoli_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Outside, it's so dark outside... I'd better wait for your work to be over and go back together! Meow! Don't leave me alone!"
 AntoniodaNoli_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Well-today you are sternly ignoring me! Your chief is a badass!... Hey, are you just baked cookies? They are delicious! Hee hee, I like you the most. Meow!"
 UgolinoVivaldi_TouchDialog_1:0 "Oh~Ah~ It shouldn’t matter if you don’t participate in the training, anyway-the sir will not be willing to punish me, right?...Oh! Sister Veneto, I was wrong! Don’t pull my ears!"
 UgolinoVivaldi_TouchDialog_2:0 "Threat in the air? What is that? It's not worth mentioning at all."
 UgolinoVivaldi_TouchDialog_3:0 "The fourteenth expulsion team is the strongest!"
 UgolinoVivaldi_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sir, do you want to know the secret about Antonio? Hehehe~ Come with me tonight."
 UgolinoVivaldi_TouchDialog_5:0 "Let me tell you, Aviere...very interesting~! Would you like to see it with your own eyes?"
 UgolinoVivaldi_TouchDialog_6:0 "Hey, Sir, being happy is my happiest thing. It would be so happy if I could rest in your warm office every night."
 UgolinoVivaldi_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sir~Official~Old~People~Get up and make breakfast soon! Otherwise, Ugolini will start the punishment game!"
 UgolinoVivaldi_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hehehe, sir, you went to molest Antonio and I saw you yesterday! If you don't want me to tell Sister Veneto...hehe, behave, um-I want to play horseback riding."
 UgolinoVivaldi_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Ah-you accidentally smashed your office glass, but you are so good, you won't blame us...ah, blame me."
 UgolinoVivaldi_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The night is really charming, and you are also charming, hey, sir, do you think Ugolini looks good with a daisy on his head?"
 UgolinoVivaldi_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Unexpectedly, you unexpectedly attacked and had such a romantic candlelight dinner. But-I brought Aviere back tonight... For candlelight dinner... You can only choose one person~"
 UgolinoVivaldi_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "With you, there is never a lack of joy. Hey, although I often tease you, I feel like I can't live without you."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_1:0 "Excellent performance? These are nothing to boast about, only the real record is the criterion for evaluation."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_2:0 "Fantasy? If it's just about speed, I'm not afraid of it at all. Of course, it doesn't make sense, because it's not just about speed to consider whether a ship is good."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_3:0 "With strong power, we must work harder and complete more tasks."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_4:0 "I see that Comrade, you have a lot of precious collections. It is recommended to find a place to save them. If the enemy invades and damages these, I am afraid you will be sad."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_5:0 "Guest ship, really handsome title...Although it's just a false name, I want to be called that way..."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_6:0 "Huh...today passed without incident, it would be nice if we can continue like this...no, no, what am I thinking about, sorry..."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Comrades, although the situation is not very optimistic, you should also pay attention to your daily diet and rest. The body is the capital of the revolution."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "When training, I always think of you and get distracted, but sometimes because of this, I will perform better. I really don’t know if this is right or wrong..."
  Tashkent_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It seems that you are also worried about something... You are in a bad mood recently. If you have something, don't hold it in your heart. It will be much easier to say it."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The pursuit of the strongest is the long-cherished wish of every soldier, but as far as I am concerned, as long as you are by my side, I am already very satisfied."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Sorry, comrade, for me, the word romance is really difficult to understand. Maybe you need to show me what romance is..."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Do you want to look into the distance of the sea? Unfortunately, no matter how good my telescope is, I can't see the end. If I can move forward with you, I want to know what the world over there will be like."
 Engels_TouchDialog_1:0 "Not all people understand and support our construction, but we cannot deny its greatness."
 Engels_TouchDialog_2:0 "Comrades, don't be blinded by your degenerate and decadent lifestyle!"
 Engels_TouchDialog_3:0 "Because I have a firm belief, my firepower can compete with battleships."
 Engels_TouchDialog_4:0 "Well...just make it difficult for you to hold it for a while...it's not because you hold warm...you should be grateful to me"
 Engels_TouchDialog_5:0 "Huh...huh...huh? I prefer to eat sweets (sleep talk)"
 Engels_TouchDialog_6:0 "That kind of black drink looks terrifying, it will corrode people's hearts... Well... it's so sweet, it's so delicious!"
 Engels_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "This, and that, in short, all the sweets in this cabinet, I want to eat all of them, pack them for me!"
 Engels_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Haha, does my new dress look good, hey, where are you looking? It doesn't matter, you can still lift me up and see enough."
 Engels_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "What do you like me to call you, dear? General? Comrade? Or...? Huh? This is too strange. But it is indeed your style."
 Engels_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Fireworks? Fireworks are my favorite!"
 Engels_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Tell me a story? I am not a kid, you hold me, I will tell you a story, I know a lot."
 Engels_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I am afraid of the dark, hug me tight. Haha, you don't really think I am afraid of the dark. Huh?! It's true that I like being hugged by you."
 Albacore_TouchDialog_1:0 "It's cool under the water in summer, won't the commander come together? Huh? Can't do it? Cut~ It's so boring!"
 Albacore_TouchDialog_2:0 "Albacore tuna? Don't call me that! No, no, it's not tasty, it's not tasty! Can't be made!"
 Albacore_TouchDialog_3:0 "Shooting fish! I caught you! Ah-what! It turned out to be the commander... Ah? No laziness! This is a drill, a drill!"
 Albacore_TouchDialog_4:0 "The moon is so beautiful! Hmm! Call my sisters and go hide and seek by the beach!"
 Albacore_TouchDialog_5:0 "Occasionally, I will encounter real mackerel in the sea, huh? What do you do after seeing it?...big eyes and small eyes..."
 Albacore_TouchDialog_6:0 "Dafeng doesn't listen to me. He obviously just wants to make friends, but every time I see me, he is always one... Commander, is there any good way to do it!"
 Albacore_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Commander, I'm going to dive into practice. I won't see it for a long time. Would you miss me?"
 Albacore_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Every time I am with you, something very interesting happens. There is nothing happier than this."
 Albacore_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The big mackerel is the first to win! Hehe, then I can take a break and have more time with you!"
 Albacore_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Commander, let me tell you that recently there is often a red-haired, witch-like person on the beach at night saying things that I don’t understand. It’s scary...Oh, it hurts, I’m wrong, I I will rest on time."
 Albacore_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Envy my skin...hee hee, as long as you soak in the water every day like me, you can do it~Commander~"
 Albacore_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I really want to be stronger so that I can take on more responsibilities...Hmm? Don’t you want me to be like that?... Don’t worry, I’m not a child, I know there will be a lot of burdens, but I I won’t be afraid...not to mention, you are still there!"
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_1:0 "Every day of training is very exciting!"
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_2:0 "Don't be anxious when releasing the torpedo...Don't be anxious...find the opportunity...Hey! Hit!"
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey, why just get together with my sister... Everyone is staring at me... Is there anything weird here and here?"
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_4:0 "My sister's record is really outstanding... When will I be able to catch up with her?"
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_5:0 "Because there is no time for training during the day, only at night will I have time to do some research that I like."
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, can you ask for a leave? I want to take a walk in the nearby waters."
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ah! Is it dawn? Even the commander is up! It seems that I am so obsessed with research that I forget the time, Commander, I may have to rest for a while, I can't eat breakfast with you, sorry."
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hey~! A big fish was fished out today! Commander, let's think about how to eat it!"
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Everyone thinks that big mackerel is better than me... What do you think? Is it possible for me to surpass her?"
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The research of animals and plants in the ocean is very interesting. Will the Commander be with me... It will be very interesting with your company."
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Because of diligent research and wandering around, I haven't had many friends in the port area. Hey, the commander is the best person to me except for mackerel and spurfish!"
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Is it a little boring at night...Would you like to go out to play together?"
 M1_TouchDialog_1:0 "Commander, I can end the existence of the war, hurry up and send me to the battlefield!"
 M1_TouchDialog_2:0 "Dodge...Dodge...Today's training content is how to avoid collision with everyone..."
 M1_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey! Today is really a good day to play! Ahh
 M1_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, are you questioning my record? I tell you, I hit Miss Hood with 1 shot and 4 torpedoes at a distance of 900 meters! Hehehehe..."
 M1_TouchDialog_5:0 "I'm still young and need a good rest, so I won't stay up late to work with you...whoop..."

 U47_TouchDialog_2:0 "The sir is going to start working? I am going to rest. Only by taking a good rest during the day can I exert my strength in the training at night."
 U47_TouchDialog_3:0 "If you can't find me...grumbling...it should be normal..."
 U47_TouchDialog_4:0 "Guruguru...Sir, would you like to dive with me?"
 U47_TouchDialog_5:0 "To improve your torpedo hit, you need to continue to work hard."
 U47_TouchDialog_6:0 "Is the sir still working? I'm going to train, and then I won't see me..."
 U47_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The sir also wants to go into the water to accompany me? The water is fun~ I can show you many beautiful scenery."
 U47_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I just went out to play with Deutsche, Bismarck and others yesterday and last night!... I, I didn't drink! No!"
  U47_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Please give me beer and grilled meat for lunch today!... Hee hee, occasionally I want to say something so handsome..."
 U47_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Yeah! Commander!...Hey, are you scared by me!...Wait a minute, don't get so close, woo-"
 U47_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The sir seems to be free tonight, so I won't dive anymore. I suddenly want to take a walk with you, hehe~"
 U47_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Sir--! I'm back!...Ah, what, I fell asleep by myself first, and said I would wait for me, really...Oh, oh! Why is it suddenly in your arms? Now... Are you pretending to be asleep? Humph! Chief badass! Bullying!"
 U505_TouchDialog_1:0 "There are a lot of people in the port area. It won't be great if you get hit by accident during training..."
 U505_TouchDialog_2:0 "My actions follow your instructions. Please make the most correct decision."
 U505_TouchDialog_3:0 "Although submarines are fighting alone in most cases, each battle is strategically related to each other, just like our wolf pack tactics~"
 U505_TouchDialog_4:0 "Okay...so sleepy, ah...no, I can't slack off, I want to be a hero like U47 predecessors!"
 U505_TouchDialog_5:0 "Too much pressure is not good, sir... pay more attention to rest. If you encounter any setbacks at work, you can talk to me."

 Surcouf_TouchDialog_3:0 "Which, where did the freighter come from! Good, good risk..."
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's time to tell the general about ocean voyages again. Be good."
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_5:0 "What about the helmet... I can't find it..."
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_6:0 "It's night, it's really disturbing..."
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I'm going to sea. Is the general still awake? Forget it, leave a note."
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Can you wait for me a little bit? I put my helmet on...well, I'm really sorry."
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I encountered a lot of danger when I went to sea today. Maybe I need some sweets to suppress my shock."
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "All this will not be a dream, awkwardly, I met the perfect you, and sometimes fate can really make a lot of jokes."
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Oh, I always lose everything, I won't cause you trouble..."

 Hindenburg_TouchDialog_1:0 "Although the lion is a bit pedantic, it is also a respectable opponent. As for Missouri...huh, one day, I will let her kneel in front of me and beg for mercy... you just wait for a good show!"
 Hindenburg_TouchDialog_2:0 "Zeppelin, Z46, give me a good air defense. These guys who only buzz in the sky are really annoying!"
 Hindenburg_TouchDialog_3:0 "The crystallization of Deutsche Technology...Huh, Bismarck, if only this level is available, then forget it."
 Hindenburg_TouchDialog_4:0 "Missouri, finally let me catch you, this time, I must...you, you stop me!"
 Hindenburg_TouchDialog_5:0 "Glory? This kind of words that are only pedantic knights would say that someone would say it? The truth of the world is always in the hands of people with superior strength. If you still refuse to admit this reality, then Let me break this ridiculous dream."
 Hindenburg_TouchDialog_6:0 "How come there are so many files...Obviously, as long as the enemy is surrendered through battle, what's the use of these things?"
 Hindenburg_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Judging from the new battle report, it seems that there are still miscellaneous fish who are unwilling to surrender to you... Hmph-although they admire their courage, I am afraid they can only play tricks now..."
 Hindenburg_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Today's exercise is our home court. We must...eh? Miss Bismarck, if you don't want your sister to be injured, you'd better wake her up now!"
 Hindenburg_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sir, looking at your restlessness, is anyone embarrassing you?...Tell me who it is! Don't worry, I won't be messed up."
 Hindenburg_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The sir will be back soon. I need to prepare some... um-perfume, lipstick...No, what's wrong with me? No, no, how can I change myself for others! Let the sir change me for me! Yes! To conquer...Will it be easier for me to be more feminine..."
 Hindenburg_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Is it an urgent task? It looks a bit tricky... Then I will go straight away. I don’t have to wait for my return today. I’ll rest early. I want to eat cake tomorrow morning, don’t forget."
 Hindenburg_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "A person who swears to protect for life, an ideal to conquer the world, I have. But those so-called "knights" still dare not agree with me... But it's okay. Those who don't recognize me use force to do it. It's solved! Then, I will call "The Last Knight"! Hahaha! How is it? Not bad!"
 QueenElizabeth_TouchDialog_1:0 "Power is no longer a problem, you don't need to worry too much."
 QueenElizabeth_TouchDialog_2:0 "The maintenance of weapons after the war is also very important. The main gun of the concubine body is particularly critical, and it must be taken care of."
 QueenElizabeth_TouchDialog_3:0 "Huh, the powerful firepower of my concubine body will never lose to my colleagues at any time."

 DukeofYork_TouchDialog_6:0 "I really want to fight Tirbitz once...but not now, but when she truly realizes why she is fighting, she will be a good knight, only at this point I and Bismarck has the same view."
 DukeofYork_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Are you actually interested in swordsmanship? But before that, you need to understand the spirit of chivalry. I hope you can learn from the story of St. Edward and St. George... Hey, how about people?"

 Iowa_TouchDialog_1:0 "Missouri, can you tell your fans not to squat downstairs at six o'clock every day? Even if they squat, let them be quiet, I have to take a beauty sleep."
 Iowa_TouchDialog_2:0 "Ah, Miss Hindenburg...are you looking for Missouri?...Unfortunately, she is not there...but if you come to her for training that you two usually like, I can do it for you...please rest assured, although I still Not very familiar, but I will work hard."

 Iowa_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Missouri is more suitable for acting as a star in a movie. In my case... I still want to go shopping like an ordinary person. The feeling of being surrounded by people for interviews is really bad."
 Iowa_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Don't always think about giving everything to yourself, you have worked hard, you have worked hard, it’s okay to take a break, yes, yes, close your eyes, find the most comfortable position for yourself, and sleep. ."

 Roma_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Huh-I'm so mad, I just wanted to go out to play, but I was caught by Miss Harrier and wouldn't let me go out, so I consumed a little fuel. As for being so stingy... Sir, you will judge. "

 SovetskySoyuz_TouchDialog_1:0 "Comrade Commander, do you ask me what I think about weapons? The more turrets, the better, the larger the caliber, the better!"
 SovetskySoyuz_TouchDialog_2:0 "Go and play together? I think if you have time, comrade, you should step up your armaments."
 SovetskySoyuz_TouchDialog_3:0 "Comrade Commander, I think there is some bad negative atmosphere in your port area, and it may need to be cleaned up."
 SovetskySoyuz_TouchDialog_4:0 "I like watching the stars at night. The deep night sky makes people feel quiet."
 SovetskySoyuz_TouchDialog_5:0 "Comrade, your hands are warm, hot enough to melt the steel (blush)."
 SovetskySoyuz_TouchDialog_6:0 "Comrade, please hug me tightly. I had a nightmare just now. It was winter in my dream and it was so cold."
 SovetskySoyuz_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Dear comrade, do you want to go out? Come here, bow your head (kiss)."

 Dunkerque_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Richelieu seems to be more feminine than before, how did she do it..."

 Dunkerque_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh-work is done, do you want to go for a walk? Or do you have other arrangements?"
 Strasbourg_TouchDialog_1:0 "Unable to strengthen my beliefs, just because of the subtle tilt of the balance, I chose to betray my motherland and burn the resistance of others. For this reason, I hate betrayers."
 Strasbourg_TouchDialog_2:0 "Hello, General. I hope you can also join the next exercise. Although it is not a real battlefield, I still hope you can witness with your own eyes-your soldiers are ready for war."
 Strasbourg_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hood... not familiar, nor unfamiliar. That humiliation has always reminded me: to be stronger, strong enough to defend the motherland-strong enough to reciprocate her original "entertainment"."

 Strasbourg_TouchDialog_5:0 "I admire General Richelieu very much. Being able to fight with her and accept her command is like a commendation to me."
 Strasbourg_TouchDialog_6:0 "General, you also have a greater mission. Even if the work is urgent, you have to take a break. Please leave the remaining work to me. I will not let you down."
 Strasbourg_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hood is actually keen on raising cats... Could it be that the two cats hide some magical power? Interesting, let's find time to conduct a contact experiment."
 Strasbourg_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "General, do you need to prepare for approaching cats? Canned food? That's why it is a good idea to use food to corrupt their will."
 Strasbourg_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "There is no secret to success, only unremitting efforts and firm belief. General, your squat training is not over yet. If you don't want me to offend you with your sword, please get up from the ground."
 Strasbourg_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The time is up. According to the information obtained from observation and analysis, the two cats will run out of the room in the near future. Then they only need to lie in ambush on their only way to catch them smoothly."
 Strasbourg_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Canned...is it so delicious? I also-the unspeakable taste, this thing will corrode the will... But the goal now is you-capture success."
 Strasbourg_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Are you a biomimetic robot? But this touch is not like...how did you suddenly make a gurgling sound? Is the memory stored in the chin...record it, and then look for the next weakness"

 GustavV_TouchDialog_2:0 "Any ship has its own home field, mine-used to be in the Baltic Sea, now it is here."
 GustavV_TouchDialog_3:0 "A lot of people are discussing Deutsche? She can come and fight with me directly. No matter how many times I come, I won't lose to her."
 GustavV_TouchDialog_4:0 "Actually, I am good at more than just fighting. Whether it is music, art or tennis, I will not lose to the commander."
 GustavV_TouchDialog_5:0 "Fighting should not injure innocent people, no matter what kind of battle is carried out, you must not forget this."

 Shoukaku_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Cute little guy~ No matter how long I stay by your side, I won’t get tired of it. Did you do anything to me quietly~ If you don’t explain clearly, the big sister will have to "double back" Oh~"

 Shinano_TouchDialog_2:0 "Woo...I envy the predecessors of the First Air War, who can control the carrier-based aircraft so skillfully. When can I make the "Tianhe" soar in the air like this..."
 Shinano_TouchDialog_3:0 "My pride-of course it is the flight deck! Unique defense! No matter what kind of attack you can do! Uh... I'm a little bit overwhelmed, cough."
 Shinano_TouchDialog_4:0 "Huh? Where did the sound come from? It won't be-fish, torpedoes!!!? Illusion...I can be on land now, ha...haha..."
 Shinano_TouchDialog_5:0 "My sisters and the heroes galloping on the battlefield are really unforgettable. If I can also use the same caliber gun, what will it be like? Oh... "Tianhe", what should I do? what……"
 Shinano_TouchDialog_6:0 "Well, when you take off against the wind, you need to... This place is like this... Huh? Admiral? Is there anything? Huh? The clerk wants me to deal with it? Is there such a thing?"
 Shinano_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I will work harder! To repay the admiral's kindness! "Tianhe", let us refuel together! First of all, endurance training-ten kilometers long run! Just follow me and fly... Ah, add fuel first "
 Shinano_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ha...Ha...Ha, ten kilometers...It's just that. Okay! It's a break now! Ah, the admiral~ I came back at the prescribed time, isn't it great! What is today's reward What~"
 Shinano_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Admiral and Admiral! Listen to me! Just now I ran into a blond little sister, but my heart beat at a glance! Just the same as when I first met the Admiral! Is this also in love...well, what should I do? Woolen cloth……"
 Shinano_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Huh...this training is so strict...but in order to become stronger...to catch up with my sisters! What's more, the admiral is also cheering for me, how can I be so discouraged! Kaga-senpai! Please! Keep training! I'm ready!"

  Formidable_TouchDialog_3:0 "Your Majesty, it’s a coincidence... But let me remind you that the opportunity to collect stamps is precious, but I also hope you can pay attention to the time... Being late for training is a very demeaning thing... As for me, I need to prepare equipment , There is no time to do those meaningless things."
 Formidable_TouchDialog_4:0 "There are many precious reagents that you can't buy in ordinary shops... Fortunately, there is an underground market near the port area... Ah? Commander, you are here, I just... didn't say anything, I didn't say anything ."
 Formidable_TouchDialog_5:0 "I envy that there are so many people in Yubari who are willing to be guinea pigs for experimentation. If I am... hey? Commander, you are here, I know you like me the most. Come and drink it."
 Formidable_TouchDialog_6:0 "By condensing the power of the potion, I can transform its power through my ship equipment, thus becoming a weapon for my battle... Although the price is that I can't use too much each time, but... I am not weak enough to rely on Win by quantity."

 Formidable_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Commander, where are you going? If you go out without saying hello...but it will make me unhappy~ I don't want to use the potion on my waist, just say it."
 Formidable_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I have been busy all night without knowing it... Sleepy and hungry... Hey? Is this the commander’s breakfast?... I really like to be nosy, forget it, it’s rare for someone to remember me and just let me Feel the warmth of the world."
 Formidable_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Commander, are you so busy today? Drink some tea, I personally make it... How does it taste? Does it feel that it doesn’t taste right... Don’t hold back, this is the strengthening potion I just prepared, look for You did an experiment, how do you feel now?"
 Formidable_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I'm going out, do you want to be with me? Although the underground store is nothing to look at, but it hides many dark sides that a little guy like you can't even think of. Would you like to see it?"
 Formidable_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Would you like to learn alchemy with me? This is not the kind of Polaroid in the animation, but the real alchemy full of darkness and filth. Are you afraid?"
 Wasp_TouchDialog_1:0 "Apart from protecting yourself on the battlefield, the most important thing is to help those in need."
 Wasp_TouchDialog_2:0 "Some enemies are always fantasizing that I died in their hands. I really want to see their faces when they meet next time."
 Wasp_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey...I'm training every day, it's really boring."
 Wasp_TouchDialog_4:0 "The people of E country are still very humorous, but at this point they are very compatible with me~"
 Wasp_TouchDialog_5:0 "Whether you are fighting the enemy or helping the friendly forces, don't lose sight of one or the other. After all, you can only help others if you guarantee the most complete situation."
 Wasp_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, I also have a knack for practicing night flying...but, um...not very proficient."
 Wasp_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Did you come to see me training? Hmm...If you accidentally get embarrassed, don't laugh at me! (Lower) Of course, I think you should not see it!"
 Wasp_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hey, although I was set on fire at the beginning, it doesn't mean that I lost. How about, do you know how good I am?"
 Wasp_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "People from Country G like to dodging even during exercises... Hipper! Come out for me, I, I have seen you!"
 Wasp_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The reason for being set on fire? Actually, it's nothing. It's just that one of the small planes released is missing. Although I know that the victory exercise is very important, I can't help but consider their safety..."
 Wasp_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, the view of the Atlantic Ocean is very fascinating. Would you like to take a leisurely time to take a look?... Miss Wasp's invitation is very precious!"
 Wasp_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It's so late, even if it's a wasp, you have to take a good rest. It's fireflies flying around at night, but it's not me... At this time, can you give me a goodnight kiss?"
 Essex_TouchDialog_1:0 "(Commander, team training should be in the first place! What an ineffective guy, don’t you even know this? How did you become a superior commander?)"
 Essex_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sister Enterprise's record is really a legend... (Does the commander know who created this legend with her? Ha! I can't speak!)"
 Essex_TouchDialog_3:0 "Bell...(It's under! Essex and Miss Essex are close partners! Every action on the battlefield) I beg you."
 Essex_TouchDialog_4:0 "Have so many expectations... (If you fail, you will lose your face! Don't make some strange instructions to embarrass us!)"
 Essex_TouchDialog_5:0 "Regardless of success or failure, never forget..."
  Essex_TouchDialog_6:0 "(The commander is not asleep yet, are you interested in the story of the "blue ghost"? If you ask me, I will consider telling it to you, haha!)"

 Essex_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "HuhIs my performance still satisfactory? (Haha, Essex, this guy must flatter you, he doesn't actually watch your performance at all) Hmm...really? Commander official?"
 Essex_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The predecessors are so good, can I do it too? Commander...You are always comforting."
 Essex_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I hope the two will be alone? We have not always been...Oh, you said Bell...Bell, I will get you something delicious...hee hee, is this... okay?"
 Essex_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "(Bell: Essex asked me to bring you coffee. Although I was reluctant, it was her request. If you dare to bully her in the future, I definitely want you to look good!)"
 Essex_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Actually, Bell has helped me a lot. Apart from you, I am not very good at communicating. Thanks to it... (Yes! Thanks to me! You two can chat so happily now!)"
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_1:0 "Keep exercising, Admiral, let’s start morning exercises together today."
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_2:0 "The radar I am equipped with is the same model as Senior Xianghe!"
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_3:0 "I want to go to the other side of the ocean to see the scenery there..."
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_4:0 "Night is a good time to fix it! Check the condition of the carrier aircraft now, and then perform maintenance... Well! It's another busy night."
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_5:0 "Um-how to remove this place... Please, teach me!"
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_6:0 "How come there are so many documents, Admiral, have you neglected your duty? Ah-it's really a headache!"
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 ""War" is really a bad thing. Ever since it had it, everything has changed. Those hateful guys appeared on the favorite sea, and there is no way for people to sail freely. I hate them."
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Fighting is something I have never thought of. But in order to protect everyone, I have to use these weapons and have to make sacrifices. What I want to do is obviously just carrying everyone on the sea..."
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Stop talking about these sad things! Admiral, do you want to go sailing on the sea? Come, hug me~ Let's go!"
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "At least...protect you...huh...ahh that as a secretary to fall asleep before the admiral..."
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Don't be angry, I have prepared a gift, but I forgot to give it to you... No, I'm not defending it. Um... I was wrong, I'm sorry. It's a rare day, but I still didn't celebrate it properly. I ..."
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I know, this is a bad habit. It should be corrected, but...I don't want to correct it yet. As for the reason, you will understand."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_1:0 "Admiral, don't always mess around, it's a headache."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_2:0 "Cooking is also one of my special skills, it's not the degree of lip service."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_3:0 "There have been twists and turns in the modification, but fortunately it was completed without incident. So now I can stand in front of the admiral."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_4:0 "Thinking back to the past, the living room environment is really-but now it is wartime, those things will only make people relax, it is better not to configure."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_5:0 "Know the situation of each carrier-based aircraft well, otherwise it will suddenly break down on the battlefield, but it is not something that can be solved by joking."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_6:0 "What's wrong with me suddenly? Ah, it's this question again...how many times have I told you about it, can you remember it once..."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Huh? What's the matter? You have this idea of ​​"teasing" me. Why don't you help the workers carry spare parts for the main gun. Do you know what I mean? Go when you know, don’t stand Obstructing others here."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Fuel...steel...well, the inventory is complete. Next is the aluminum bar-ah, is it "Tianhe"? What are you doing in the warehouse? Wait, if you are there, then explain-Miss, Are you here?"
 Junyou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Admiral, the reason for the abnormal consumption of resources this week has been found. I'm very sorry, but I made a calculation error, and actually did not consume excessive resources...What's the matter? Look at me with strange eyes?"
 Junyou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Some idiots are not good at expressing. They have already arrived but can’t speak. They clearly prepared the gift but don’t know when to take it out. In the end, it’s me who is injured. How can this clumsy guy make me leave? what……"
 Junyou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Is the official business over? Today, as always, has been dragged to the present. Congratulations. The mattress is already laid, so let's spend the rest of the time here. Then, it's time to say "good night"."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh? It's a cookie that a cute little guy gave me. I like the taste very much, so I don't have your share. It's useless to look at me with that kind of eyes, I'm not a fool."
 Houshou_TouchDialog_1:0 "The first is not always a good thing, whether it is training or improvement, all have to be explored from scratch."
 Houshou_TouchDialog_2:0 "Although I am called "senior", I always feel that I don't play a big role..."
 Houshou_TouchDialog_3:0 "Long Xiang, the child, puts too much emphasis on his own existence. It's a little weird to call himself "Zan"."

 Houshou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I miss them for years when they were young. They crowded around me like dolls and asked where to ask. Now, this kind of scene can only rely on memories. When children grow up, they will be embarrassed and very embarrassed. Normal things..."
 Houshou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It’s hello, I’m willing to listen to these grievances... Sure enough, I feel much better after I say it. In order to thank you for listening to so much nonsense, I should make a delicious meal to reward you. okay."
 Houshou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Would you like another glass of wine? I have a lot more, don't be too cautious. Ah, don't thank me, thank the child if you want to, these are her masterpieces."
 Houshou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "...That is to say, those children are totally inconsiderate... I am also very hard... Wine! Another... Another glass!"
 Houshou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The head hurts... It's not yet the next day... The kid's wine is so vigorous... Admiral... Are you still... awake?"
 Hermes_TouchDialog_1:0 "Is Richelieu coming in a while? Then, then I will go first...I will come back when she leaves..."
 Hermes_TouchDialog_2:0 "Each battle has its own particularities, so it is necessary to adjust the ship's equipment according to different battles. Of course, these things should be considered clearly when designing, so... you can avoid a lot of unnecessary trouble... "
 Hermes_TouchDialog_3:0 "Senior Hundred Eyes Giant, the tactics written in your lesson plan are a bit outdated. If you don't mind, how about letting me prepare lessons with you?"
 Hermes_TouchDialog_4:0 "Although it pointed out the deficiencies of the Hundred Eyes Giants, preparing lessons is really a headache. Can the commander help me?"
 Hermes_TouchDialog_5:0 "Do you want to apologize? Although it was only because of the order that I had to... But after all, it was something I did personally, and I can't transfer the responsibility to others... But what should I do..."
 Hermes_TouchDialog_6:0 "Isn't this the Prince of Wales? Didn't fight back with you? Hee hee, I really envy you two, you are together at all times."
 Hermes_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Guruguru~guruguru~ Hee hee, look, look, commander, come and see here! The little hamster is running so cute, Commander, can we raise one?"
 Hermes_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Is the commander busy with work? About what time will he be back? Well, I will prepare the meal in advance and wait for you, but don't be late, or I will be angry--! "
 Hermes_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Miss Unicorn has a pretty good understanding of aircraft maintenance and helped me a lot when preparing lessons. In this case... the new textbook is complete! Hope it will be helpful to everyone's training! Commander , Would you like to come and give this new textbook a name?"
 Hermes_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Am I really qualified to lead everyone to the light? Without you, I wouldn't be able to hold on to the present... Fortunately, I have you."
 Hermes_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I really feel at ease after speaking what I have in my heart. No matter what Miss Richelieu and Miss Hood think in their hearts, I feel that what is unjust is unjust. If I don’t apologize, I won’t feel at ease. Yes... Has the commander ever encountered such a thing? "
 Hermes_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The moon has risen, Commander, you see, the night sky tonight is so beautiful...it has been busy all the time, how long have we not seen the moon and the stars together like this?"
 Bearn_TouchDialog_1:0 "In country F, I am a unique aircraft carrier! Hehehehe, in terms of dignity, even Richelieu can't match me."
 Bearn_TouchDialog_2:0 "Yes, what's so funny! It's just a water bomber. Wait, when I have an excellent bomber, I can compete with you too! (Proud)"
 Bearn_TouchDialog_3:0 "Heh heh, my marksmanship is good, right?...Who said the aircraft carrier marksmanship is useless! What should I do if the enemy is close?"
 Bearn_TouchDialog_4:0 "So many sisters of the Normandy, why is it that I am the only one who transformed into an aircraft carrier... Obviously a battlecruiser is more suitable..."
 Bearn_TouchDialog_5:0 "Damn...If I didn't run too slowly, how could I lose so badly... Hey, let's start exercising tonight!"
 Bearn_TouchDialog_6:0 "Huh-although I have said so many complaints, I will try to do everything, after all, the past cannot be changed, the reality is right in front of us, the future... who knows."
 Bearn_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey-ladies of the aircraft carrier wait for me, okay, so tired! ... I'm sorry, sorry, my sailing speed is a bit slow..."
 Bearn_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Although I am a little afraid of the future, but with you, I am not afraid at all, hehe~"
 Bearn_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hey, today’s task is to deliver the gold nugget box? Is anyone with me? Emerald and Edinburgh? Although they are not very familiar, they seem to be two reliable partners, hehe..."
 Bearn_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Of all the emotions, love is the most selfish... Strange, why can't I feel it... Hey! Wait, it's Lai! Sai! Stay! Unforgivable!"
 Bearn_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It is said that... a person with an open mind will smile and say it even if he encounters something that is bothering him, hehe, are you such a person?"

 Mogami_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's rare for a child to take the initiative to make a request. As a senior, I have to respond well."
 Mogami_TouchDialog_5:0 "Mr. Admiral! Don't open that bag! This is "specially made" for my sister~ Can you understand?"
 Mogami_TouchDialog_6:0 "Huh, what you look like at work is really fascinating. I moved a little bit~ eh? In what way~"
 Mogami_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Cute little guy~ No matter how long I stay by your side, I won’t get tired of it. Did you do something to me quietly~ If you don’t explain clearly, the big sister will have to "double back" Oh~"

 Mogami_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hi~ You seem to be more confident. Well, the special training is so great for you. Ah, is this a thank you gift? Wait...couldn't she give you it? Haha ~Anyway, thank you first, and I have to do my best in the future~"
 Mogami_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I have been busy for a day, it is really a pain in the back...Either training or on duty, no one can be delayed. Ah, Mr. Admiral~ Come and give me a massage~ All, body, all, want, oh~"
 Mogami_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Eyes are the window of the soul~Mr. Admiral, what is your inner world like? Come~ stare into my eyes~ don't hide from your sight, is there anything to be shy? Hey~ you are surprised. Innocent~"

 Mikuma_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hello! Today is also full of enthusiasm, Mr. Admiral! Let's meet the companions who are returning to Hong Kong together!"
 Mikuma_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sister! Don't be serious about this kind of thing every time! It's my own business to show my forehead!"
 Mikuma_TouchDialog_3:0 "Here, here~ I came up with a good idea! Humph, get ready to compliment me~"
 Mikuma_TouchDialog_4:0 "The equipment of the battleship is really huge... It feels like it will be crushed at any time, I really admire the seniors."

 Mikuma_TouchDialog_6:0 "Mr. Admiral, do you want to come and play together? This is a new work released this month, I'm really looking forward to it!"
 Mikuma_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Wow! Isn't this the new game on the market?! You have already bought it! Can I join in? In exchange, this piece of cake is for you!"
 Mikuma_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Didn't I say not to break into the room suddenly? Even if you are a sister, you have to consider your sister's feelings! Hey...Isn't it intentional? Then, that's it!"
 Mikuma_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Admiral, what do you think of this dress? Sure enough... it's very beautiful, and the price is as "pretty" as well. I really want to... ooh..."
 Mikuma_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Although my sister makes some very rude jokes occasionally, she still thinks about us, but she won't show it so obviously. If she were more frank, I wouldn't quarrel with her... "
 Mikuma_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Ah! It hurts! It hurts! Who puts the stand here!? There is really no ethics! Don't let me know who did it, or you will look good!"
 Mikuma_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It's boring at night... Admiral, tell a few stories to listen to? Anything, as long as it can relieve the boredom-ah! Ghost stories are not good! Your expression just now definitely wanted to scare me!?"

 Kumano_TouchDialog_6:0 "Although there is a quarrel, but the sisters are not really at odds. This is also a manifestation of "fetters"."
 Kumano_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "What does "Forest" look like? Although I have seen it in the film, I always feel that something is missing. Um... it's probably a "sense of presence"?"
 Kumano_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Because it is the navy, I am eager to land more! The feeling of being down-to-earth is better than eating fresh salmon and two tuna!"
 Kumano_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "What kind of cry does the real Mr. Bear make? It's like going on an adventure in the forest, and then becoming good friends with Mr. Bear! But my sisters don't allow me to go out alone... really disappointing."
 Kumano_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Admiral! Look at the empty stove over there! Let's grill the salmon! Then you are responsible for making the fire, and the job of grilling the fish will be left to me! Hmm~ I can imagine the fragrance afterwards!"
 Kumano_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "My sister’s birthdayhey? What's the date today? No, no, no! I don’t remember the day because I am playful. I should have a better explanation! I think about... Talent! ! This word should not be used here!"
 Kumano_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I heard that there is a temple that shines at night. I really want to see it with my own eyes... I decided! If there is a holiday, I will visit it and take a photo for the admiral to see too!"

 York_TouchDialog_2:0 "It's better to act during the day. You can't see a lot of things at night, so don't move. Please!"
 York_TouchDialog_3:0 "Carrier-based aircraft hovered overhead... I was shaking all over when I think about it."
  York_TouchDialog_4:0 "Ah to think it is an enemy, it is the commander."
 York_TouchDialog_5:0 "The night is over, I really look forward to the sun."
 York_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, staying up late is a bad thing, you must have a good rest at night."
 York_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Finally got the permission to go out! My sister, this is something my sister worked hard for! We must have a good time!"
 York_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Commander~Do you want me to bring you some gifts back? If you don’t say it within three seconds, cancel it-three! Haha, you are too slow ~ remember to answer next time-if there are more Next time~"
 York_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It’s so troublesome...Xiao Ang! Hurry up! If we waste an extra second on this kind of thing, our vacation will be reduced by one second! Hairstyles--it hurts!!!"
 York_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Boss! Let's get a bottle of Guinness first! What?! There is no one?! Then there is always Pale Ale? Hey...what's the matter, let alone only ginger ale!"

 York_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Ha...ha...let, let me get it...not good...if you explain, I won't let you go! Oops? Why is everyone looking here?"
 Exeter_TouchDialog_1:0 "If you are not as strong as your sisters, you will have to intensify training."
 Exeter_TouchDialog_2:0 "Earl Spey looks more...huh? Slender?"
 Exeter_TouchDialog_3:0 "I should try my best to avoid getting into trouble during the battle, I will try my best..."
 Exeter_TouchDialog_4:0 "My sister is a little scared of carrier-based aircraft, and I am concerned about the night..."
 Exeter_TouchDialog_5:0 "Commander, you work hard, do you need a cup of coffee to refresh yourself?"
 Exeter_TouchDialog_6:0 "The figure in the distance... is it thunder?"
 Exeter_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Commander, thank you for giving us the opportunity to go out. Yes, I will be optimistic about my sister and try to keep her from getting into big trouble. Well, try to..."
 Exeter_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Judging from the information currently known, the recent bar has a pretty good reputation. Sister, why not consider going to this one?"
 Exeter_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Since you are going out, let's change into casual clothes. Wearing a uniform is a bit too ostentatious... Sister, sit down and don't move, if you get your hair, don't blame me?"
 Exeter_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I was so misguided that I didn't investigate the types of drinks provided in advance... Sister, bear with me. Use this instead, it should be... no problem, right?"
 Exeter_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The waiter-Excuse me, is there Trifle here? Just add fruit, jelly, sponge cake and-eh? Miss, where do I seem to have seen you?"

 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_3:0 "Lafite, remember, even if you are brave, you will suffer a lot from your position as a destroyer and a head-to-head battle with your battleship. Next time you have to... Don't, don't leave! Listen to me!"
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_4:0 "If the commander fails once, he will lose the trust of his subordinates. This is fatal to the battlefield."
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_5:0 "In a melee, ordering to stop firing requires more courage than ordering to fire."
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, in order to improve your commanding ability, I recommend that you read more books in your free time. Standing on the shoulders of giants makes it easier for us to understand the development of the times."
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Welltoday, take a break. I order you not to get up, lie down...huhhuhlet me be in your arms and sleep for a while..."
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Don't tell anyone what I said when I was asleep! Shame, shame--!"

 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Is my performance okay today?... Hee hee, really? Then... can you praise me more?... Hey, no matter how many honor medals you get, it’s not as good as your praise."
 Baltimore_TouchDialog_1:0 "Although you have the best equipment, you must not neglect training because of this."
 Baltimore_TouchDialog_2:0 "Any hero will be reborn under a great mission, because there will always be someone who inherits that firm belief."
  Baltimore_TouchDialog_3:0 "Quincy, Helena, Chicago... They are both heroes praised by people and my best sisters."
 Baltimore_TouchDialog_4:0 "A hero will always be remembered, just as the name of a hero will always be inherited from generation to generation."
 Baltimore_TouchDialog_5:0 "Commander, haven't you rested yet?...I'm just wondering if I can be qualified to be a hero whose descendants are proud to inherit my name."

 DesMoines_TouchDialog_2:0 "Training is over, next is the weapon maintenance time... Well-it looks like you just need some oil, come on, Commander, help me hold this place... Ah, the clothes are hanging... That, help me Can you pull the clothes? Haha, don't be shy!"
 DesMoines_TouchDialog_3:0 "Huh...If you can achieve this kind of fire suppression on the battlefield, there should be no mistakes. However, you still can't relax your vigilance and continue training. You must be more proficient in this combat method..."
 DesMoines_TouchDialog_4:0 "If I can be born earlier, maybe I can prevent many misfortunes from happening?"
 DesMoines_TouchDialog_5:0 "Woo...These words seem to be a headache...Forget it, let the Commander do it all."
 DesMoines_TouchDialog_6:0 "Wichita, don't always think about missiles and the like. Using your own advantages is what you should focus on right now."
 DesMoines_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Uh-hmm... After a long time, it still feels a little heavy. Seeing you look like you want to help me? Okay, since you have said so... This weapon is not light at all, connect it! (leave)"
 DesMoines_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hey--! Are you okay... Hey, let me see if you get hurt?... It seems better to go to the infirmary? Then... Hey! You are lighter than the equipment, go away ~! Don't mess around~"
 DesMoines_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The greater the ability, the greater the responsibility. Therefore, I cannot relax for a moment. Of course, if I am tired and tired, I will trouble you."
 DesMoines_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Oh-how can you not be tired from carrying such a heavy thing every day, Commander, come and help me pound my shoulders, harder... harder! ... Oh, harder! Yes, yes, yes, just That way!...comfortable!"
 DesMoines_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Compared to controlling the firepower of the main gun, controlling the cooking temperature is the hardest thing...Ah, why is it muddled again..."

 Zara_TouchDialog_1:0 "Veneto is an excellent leader. In comparison, the little guy Harrier is just a vase. After all, she also likes to play with those flowers and plants." Zara_TouchDialog_2:0 "别看罗马平时傻里傻气，帝国像是个书呆子，这俩人进入到战斗模式后简直像是换了个人一样，和维内托一样恐怖……"
  Zara_TouchDialog_3:0 "Dear Miss Harrier, although I know you like flowers very much, do you want to listen to me and report the results? Or I will put the results here and you will see it another day."
 Zara_TouchDialog_4:0 "You know, too? Your Excellency Veneto. Even if you look forward to Miss Harrier Eagle's future, she still won't give you a better response. You can use force outside to calm the world, and she is only in a deep boudoir. The hiding lady. How long can you protect her?"
 Zara_TouchDialog_5:0 "Is the incompetence of the subordinates the fault of the chief? Then, is the incompetence of the leader also the oversight of the subordinates? After all, good birds choose trees to live."
 Zara_TouchDialog_6:0 "This guy Ugolini is really brave. She dare to touch Veneto's head. After touching it, she puts on an expression of "I was wrong, I will dare next time"... how did she Do you rely on Rome for living to the present?"
 Zara_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Give me your hand, hold it... Come closer, we must always make sure to show my affection to the people around, understand?"
 Zara_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Never mind the cooking skills, there is no need to master this kind of things, and successful people will not cook by themselves! Do you mean it? Say yes, hurry up!"
 Zara_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Strength is not the only factor that determines the leader? What is that? Don't tell me it's love... This kind of vain thing can't bring peace to the world."
 Zara_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I thought you could write a good story after the oath, but now it looks like a mess... You can't do anything without me, can you?"
 Zara_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "If I become a leader, I will surely mess up the world because of my rude words. No, no, let’s let the good girl who plays with flowers and plants behave. I’ll be at your side. The ghost is over."
 Zara_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I'm very curious about your experience, can you tell me about it? I want to keep everything you experienced in mind."
 Algerie_TouchDialog_1:0 "General Richelieu, I have completed today's training. If there is nothing else, I will go to sort out the materials."
 Algerie_TouchDialog_2:0 "General, I have tailored a work plan for you. Please have a look. Although some of the requirements are more demanding, I hope you can gradually adapt to such a rhythm of life."
 Algerie_TouchDialog_3:0 "Huh-it seems to be another busy day, does it matter to you? Do you need my help?"
 Algerie_TouchDialog_4:0 "Imagine, the pedometer on your body shows that your exercise index today has been reduced by 30% compared to the past. Can you explain why?"
 Algerie_TouchDialog_5:0 "Walkland, you performed very well today. But...if you can be more confident, I think you will be better."
 Algerie_TouchDialog_6:0 "Why is my name "Algiers" weird in many materials? This group of people analyzes my ability without even remembering my name. It's terrible."
 Algerie_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Although it is important to complete the plan, don't force it too much. This is my warmed milk. Take a break."
 Algerie_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Do you want to go out? Hold on a minute, I have to dress up a little... That's not good, I am too sloppy at work."
 Algerie_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Don't mind, I'm just disturbing the room, some places are too dusty... Here you are, put on a mask."
 Algerie_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "No, I won't let you eat dessert at this time, absolutely not! ... It's no use begging me!"
 Algerie_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Tonight, I am dressed up. You can decide where to go."
 Algerie_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "General Richelieu, working so late every night is not good for your health... Then I will prepare some coffee for you. Although I am not as good as you in combat, I can also share some of the pressure for you."
 Katori_TouchDialog_1:0 "This shelling is wrong, it should be...whh, ah! Admiral, have you been watching for a long time?"
 Katori_TouchDialog_2:0 "Um...today's training plan...oh, it's finally completed, I don't know how everyone feels."
 Katori_TouchDialog_3:0 "Today I also prepared a training plan for the admiral~"
 Katori_TouchDialog_4:0 "Admiral, the work efficiency is so low, but it's impossible~ It seems that the admiral needs to prepare some work ability training."
 Katori_TouchDialog_5:0 "Although training can enhance your own strength, sometimes the gap between strengths and weaknesses cannot be compensated by training..."
 Katori_TouchDialog_6:0 "Tomorrow's training plan...ahh..."
 Katori_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ah!! Unexpectedly, there was an unplanned situation... I thought about getting up in the morning to make a good breakfast for the admiral, but I forgot that I had never learned to cook, what should I do, what should I do... ..."
 Katori_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Cookbooks...well...it feels so complicated, why can't it be as simple and clear as a training plan? What does this little, small amount mean!"
 Katori_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Oh...Admiral, I'm hungry, please get up and cook!"
 Katori_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The daily training plan is going on steadily, and I finally have time to date you, which is great!"
 Katori_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Ah-what should I do with an unplanned encounter?...Huh? Your admiral, is this asking me for an unplanned date request?"
 Katori_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The ingredients are confirmed, and the time to get up tomorrow morning is... OK, Katori's Good Wife Project is about to start!"
 ouyodo_TouchDialog_1:0 "Admiral, do I need to put the letter I just sent in the office?"
 ouyodo_TouchDialog_2:0 "It's not a "task" if it's just processing documents. Don't underestimate me."
 ouyodo_TouchDialog_3:0 "Ziyun Ziyun~Where are we going to play today? Hmm! I decided to be there~"
 ouyodo_TouchDialog_4:0 "I also want to make a battle for you! If necessary, please let me also play!"
 ouyodo_TouchDialog_5:0 "Occasionally I can hear distant communications at night, maybe the other side of the sea is conveying something to us..."
 ouyodo_TouchDialog_6:0 "The sea horizon at night seems to swallow everything up, please don't leave me."
 ouyodo_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "It is indeed a wise choice to nest in the admiral's room. Air-conditioning, ice cream, is there anything happier than this? Ziyun~You think so too~"
 ouyodo_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "What are you talking about, of course I can swim. I don't know when I started, I seem to have learned it unknowingly... But I might prefer the feeling of floating than swimming. Being caught by the sea Surrounded, as if I have become a part of this boundless ocean."
 ouyodo_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "...Is this time already? I have been dealing with various tasks, and I missed my meal before I knew it. Ah, admiral. Is this butter bread? Well, I like this one the most. Thank you ~"
 ouyodo_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "...It's so noisy. Ah, I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about these mosquitoes. After taking a shower, I wanted to open the windows for ventilation, but these guys all ran in... The screens? Ah, it turns out Is it there..."
 ouyodo_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "...That's it right here. Sure enough, the moon seen on the top of the mountain does not feel the same as in the port area. It should be said that it is the result of the widening of the view? No, it is climbing with my back. It’s your contribution to the top of the mountain. Right here, let’s enjoy the moon together."
 ouyodo_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "After everything is over, let's go to an unknown fishing village. There must be a sky as deep as the sea. Being under the sky is like returning to the scene of the first encounter. The fetters, like the blue ocean, will never dry up."
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_1:0 "As long as I can earn a salary, I will take it no matter what task it is~ Ah, if the disparity in strength is too great, then I will PASS~"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_2:0 "Gold can only display its charm by putting it in its own house~ Sir, can I exchange my salary for equivalent gold? Please~"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_3:0 "Surprisingly, attacking the unprepared. It breaks into the enemy camp like a bolt of lightning, and then retreats all over after completing the goal~ I can do this too!"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_4:0 "You can frighten a large number of enemies without leaving the port, wow! It's amazing! This way, you can get paid by staying in the port!"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sir, you need to pay extra for processing these documents~ Just a glass of beer~ Hey, it's still long at night~"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_6:0 "What do you plan to do with salary? Huh? Wouldn't it be a pity to use it? Of course I keep it! At this point, I am on the united front with "Dragon"~"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Of course I didn't make an oath with the chief in order to be able to manage the chief's salary. What's wrong, don't you believe me? If you make this kind of joke, the chief's living expenses this month will be confiscated!"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "One more cup~ Puff! Sir!!! This and that, ah, ah, ah, is the loot collected from the enemy! Yes! That's it! I'm checking whether it contains toxic substances! The inspection passed! I'll take it and collect it!"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The sun is so good, I really want to go swimming in the sea~ It's suffocating to stay in the port area...sir, too! You can feel the heartbeat of the sea~ It's super exciting! How is it?! Take me to swim together~"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I heard that Scheer knows where the wine cellar looks like, do you want to follow her-hello! Sir! I am inspecting the port area now! Please stay with me, I am a little afraid of the dark hahahahahaha..."
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Oh~ Your sir~ It’s almost time for a break~ Do you want to take a break together?Hey, you are so guarded! Where did you put the key to the vault  ah, ah, no Pinch me, I surrender, I surrender! I don’t dare anymore!"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "How come there are idiots who carry a box of gold nuggets with them~ I wag on the road at night, what should I do if someone intercepts them~ What do you think I do? I won't do this kind of thing. , Really, really... ah, I didn't hide anything, ha, ha ha"
 Worcester_TouchDialog_1:0 "Look at what I saw? A young commander brought a group of lovely sisters in the drill, but then all the eyes of these people will leave the less intense battlefield, because Miss Worcester is going to flash Bright is on the stage!"
 Worcester_TouchDialog_2:0 "The appearance of Miss Des Moines is too exaggerated...Well, whether it is in person or in equipment...There are not many people who are as clever and practical as I am!"
 Worcester_TouchDialog_3:0 "This chain is equipped to restrict my movement. Have you heard of weight training? ...If I use my full strength, I don't want everyone to be unemployed."
 Worcester_TouchDialog_4:0 "Wichita, missiles are flashy, don't talk about it every day, isn't it good to be an artillery cruiser?"
 Worcester_TouchDialog_5:0 "Are you underestimating the chain in my hand?...If you bully me, I won't be polite to you!"
  Worcester_TouchDialog_6:0 "The fruits of modern industry have created everything in our lives and eliminated backward ways. Then in twenty years, we should also eliminate the existing way of life and replace it with a new one... It’s always good to adapt. trouble."
 Worcester_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Would you like to see what clothes I wear today?... But what is not in the closet is OK, it will take some time to order it... Then I will correct it. What kind of clothes do you want to see next?"
 Worcester_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Miss Hornet, do you know that your name has been used by a secret organization as the project name? I just got this news recently, how about it? Are you very angry? Let's go blow up the experiment together How is the base?"
 Worcester_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Ah-laziness has been discovered. Today, I was assigned a strange task. It is all sorts of miscellaneous work. I really don't want to do it... I don't care about it. Someone else should do these things."
 Worcester_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Would you like some wine? An alcoholic drink after work is very stressful, not to mention that I made it for you."
 Worcester_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, take a break when it is time to take a break. We are all just working. Too serious will drag ourselves... Look at me. Although people sometimes say that I am heartless, I am very happy, aren't they? ?"
 Worcester_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It is not easy to keep up with the trend, Commander, this is the list of magazines I need to read. You can order them all for me."
 Oakland_TouchDialog_1:0 "Today's training, let me challenge myself. Please let the aircraft carrier ladies let me have a try."
 Oakland_TouchDialog_2:0 "It would be great if the sky were so quiet every day."
 Oakland_TouchDialog_3:0 "Don't see my main guns are less than the Atlanta-class sisters, but if you really want to fight, I won't be weaker than them!"
 Oakland_TouchDialog_4:0 "If I am patrolling, you can rest assured, I am the strongest... Hey, it seems that another fly is coming. It's really annoying. Go and rest first."
 Oakland_TouchDialog_5:0 "Take a rest tonight, but I'm always worried about other people, I'd better go see them..."
 Oakland_TouchDialog_6:0 "This beeping voice is... Atlanta? Is she still wandering around so late?... Seeing you are a little worried about her, would you like to go with her?"
 Oakland_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey, I was woken up again. When can I sleep peacefully until I wake up naturally...Huh? Did I wake you up? I'm so sorry."
 Oakland_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Huh-the shelling is still weaker, I wonder if the sacrifice is worth it?...Hmm? I know, Commander, I won't doubt myself."
 Oakland_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Recently, my spirits have improved a lot. This is your credit, Commander! Hehe, as a reward, what would you like to eat tonight? I will make it for you."
 Oakland_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Is this earplug...give it to me? But if this is the case, I won't hear anything at night, really okay?...Alright, it's up to you. I put on the earplugs and have a good night's sleep. "
 Oakland_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huhuand continue to be on guard...huhuI don’t need... rest..."
 Oakland_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Okay! It's night again, have a cup of coffee...ah! Commander, why are you taking my coffee... Hot milk can't refresh your mind, I...well, since you have said so, I will...( Yawn) whirr--"
 Cleveland_TouchDialog_1:0 "Glory should not be just empty talk, only action can prove its existence. I am on standby at any time, Commander."
 Cleveland_TouchDialog_2:0 "The aircraft carrier ladies in the task force are very strong. Under my command, they can better exert their strength. Of course, all of this is built on the basis of "trust."
 Cleveland_TouchDialog_3:0 ""Soldiers, deception. "Even if you have several times the strength of the enemy, you still need to cooperate with wisdom to win. What's wrong, is it weird for me to say it? Knowledge knows no borders, that's it."
 Cleveland_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, what are you looking at? Comics? Hey...this bookhey? No, I'm not interested, really. Only, just a little curious. Well. But then again, this book is well drawn. It's very delicate."
 Cleveland_TouchDialog_5:0 "The Bofors and Oerlikon machine guns I am equipped with are not decorations. Those ridiculous enemy planes become debris, and I don't know where the firepower caused them to scatter."
 Cleveland_TouchDialog_6:0 "Seagull, you have worked hard. Come here, I will help you replace the wings and fuel tanks. Well, it's in good condition, I have to ask you tomorrow."
  Cleveland_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 ""Technology" is a weapon that can control the situation of the battle, and it is also a counterbalance. The balance of the day is out of balance, and there will be a huge disaster."
 Cleveland_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "It's the commander. I was reading and didn't notice you coming. The books left by the sages are condensed with their extraordinary wisdom. No matter when, this is an unforgettable treasure."
 Cleveland_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "In the countless multiverse, there must be another me. Will the other me like to think like me? Or is it simpler? It may be as wild as a boy. Maybe, huhu."
 Cleveland_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Commander, what are you looking at...?! Alas...Is it still discovered. Comics are just a little fun outside of my usual professional books, do you want to watch? Then I recommend this "Tie Man", If I can also use this set of equipment, that would be great~"
 Cleveland_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The aircraft carrier lady of the task force sometimes calls me "Knight". This is also a manifestation of trust. I will not let down their expectations, and will continue to fight from now on-as their "guardian" knight"."
 Cleveland_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "If there is a armor that can be worn by people, this will definitely help the soldiers in the current battle. Unfortunately, the current technology is still far behind. This is really regrettable."
 YingSwei_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hee hee hee hee hee~ I also want to record the words and deeds of the admiral at all times today~"
 YingSwei_TouchDialog_2:0 "It should have been arranged to train with Zhaohe... but Zhaohe can't be found, can the admiral train with me?"
 YingSwei_TouchDialog_3:0 "The admiral is a bit too tired recently, I have prepared some fruits for you...please, please use it slowly."
 YingSwei_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hehehe~ I am also recording the words and deeds of the admiral at all times today~"
 YingSwei_TouchDialog_5:0 "Zhao and that bear boy, I don't know where they are going to make trouble again. Hehe~"
 YingSwei_TouchDialog_6:0 "You mean the red mark on my face? Hehehe...what is itjust the watermelon juice left after cutting the watermelon~"
 YingSwei_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Have you forgotten what you are going to do next? Let me take a look, I should write it down carefully... However, Admiral, you are always so forgetful, but it is very dangerous."
 YingSwei_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "It would be great if you can become stronger, only your heart...cannot protect the admiral."
 YingSwei_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Advisor~Supervisor~ This is today's fruit, do you like it? Tell Ying Rui if you don't like it!"
 YingSwei_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The real pain is not that you can’t ask for help, but that there is no one who can ask for help... However, if you are by your side, there is no such problem. Hehe, it makes people blush to say so. ..."
 YingSwei_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Come again! Come again! Come again!!!... Ah! Mention, Admiral... You, why are you here, just for training. How can you protect you from being strong? Let go, let go... My hand, It really doesn't matter-ah, it hurts! "
 YingSwei_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The moon tonight-ah, it's half a month, half bright and half dark, hehe, just like me."
 ChaoHo_TouchDialog_1:0 "In fact, apart from Ying Rui sister, I also have a younger sister who is studying in Greece."
 ChaoHo_TouchDialog_2:0 "Shh~Admiral, if you see Sister Yixian and Sister Yingrui, don't say you saw me."
 ChaoHo_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey, admiral, play with me, don't worry about work or anything!"
 ChaoHo_TouchDialog_4:0 "Admiral, let me tell you quietly~ Ping Hai and Ying Rui will always sneak out at night, don't know what to do..."
 ChaoHo_TouchDialog_5:0 "In fact, besides Ying Rui sister, I also have a younger sister who is studying in Greece."
 ChaoHo_TouchDialog_6:0 "Admiral, you have worked hard, this is the tea that my uncle prepared specially for you...what are you hesitating, drink it soon."
 ChaoHo_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "(Whispering) Just while the admiral is not paying attention...ahhhhh! Admiral, why are you awake! I, I don't want to run away secretly, hey, don't drag me, I will train well!"
 ChaoHo_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Huh~! I lost to the aircraft carriers again in the exercise today. No, I can’t swallow that breath. I’m going to have dinner today...ah! When did the admiral come here...no! Just kidding! I didn’t want it. do what……"

 ChaoHo_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Admiral, let's escape from this port area with me while no one is with me now, and escape to a place no one knows... Hahaha, look at you with a surprised look. You were fooled by me. You are stupid, I am I won’t go to a place where there is no Yixian eldest sister to cook~!"
 ChaoHo_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Admiral, hehehe, I am Yingrui~ What's the matter? Think of me as Zhaohe again? Then...ahhh, when did Yingrui sister be behind me, don't look at it with this look Watch me, the admiral save me!"
 ChaoHo_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Admiral~ What did you ask me to do? Hey, is there something delicious? Who made it?... Hey, I don’t know why I was disappointed to hear that you did it. I don’t care about you, so I can hardly taste some...but I want you to feed it to me!"
 Thonburi_TouchDialog_1:0 "It's boring to train in the port area every day, Admiral, I will take you to sea to fight!... Don't worry, I will be safe!"
 Thonburi_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sister Akagi! Long time no see!... Hey, I can use the gun you gave me now!"
 Thonburi_TouchDialog_3:0 "Who is making noise there...what?! From country F...Ti, admiral, I still have things to do, you go first!"
 Thonburi_TouchDialog_4:0 "Oh, what do you do with these boring text work? Let me go out and explore with me... Don't look at me helplessly, I will protect you!"
 Thonburi_TouchDialog_5:0 "I tell you guys, don't bully me, I am the second in Asia!"

 Shiratsuyu_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "No! In case you run away suddenly, where would you let me go to find you? Ah! Could it be that...Do you hate me? So... This makes sense... Gu ..."
 Shiratsuyu_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Why should I worry about this...ahhh, the less I think about it, the more I care about it?! Admiral! Can I take up some of your time? I need psychological counseling"
 Shiratsuyu_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sorry! I'm latehaha, I'm sorry to leave you alone for so long. Well, let's start training now! Before that, put the repair tools aside and nothing will happen~! "
 Shiratsuyu_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "...Where did the training bombs come from? Obviously there were only two of us in the exercise field, and the girl didn't load the bombs either-oh, it's bandaged? Thank you, sister~ I invite you to go Eat pudding!"
 Shiratsuyu_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "One hand is really inconvenient...Huh? Are you going to feed me? Sister-you are such an angel! Sister, I am so happy! If it weren't for my hand injury, I really want to hold you up and go around in circles!"
 Shiratsuyu_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I always feel that there are few puddings in the refrigerator. Admiral, have you ever eaten? No, that's really strange. Is it my illusion... By the way! Did the admiral see the fourth sister? She doesn't I know where I am going, I still have something to find her."
 Shigure_TouchDialog_1:0 "The changes in the world are always too fast, and the free time is always short. I seem to hear Bai Lu's voice again...Ah, I have to give up here. Go to the next hiding place"
 Shigure_TouchDialog_2:0 "To be able to see them again, to live together again, the rain that looms over my heart finally ushered in the day when it cleared...Ah, I'll be here soon"
 Shigure_TouchDialog_3:0 "If I can, I don't want to step on the battlefield again. No, I'm not afraid of "battle", I just... don't want to see a scene where someone is injured but I can't do anything..."
 Shigure_TouchDialog_4:0 "Senior...what's wrong with you? This area is not within the lighting range of the street light, and it is easy to hit something. There is no injury to the leg? Is it...that's good..."
 Shigure_TouchDialog_5:0 "You don't have to run over to remind me after a while... I will go back when the work is done. Okay, don't always repeat the same sentence, it's not like you at all."
 Shigure_TouchDialog_6:0 "Admiral, don't you need to rest? Because... you have been working continuously for so long, but you still don't look fatigued. However, staying up late is not a good thing, liver function will be impaired. How? Take a rest."
 Shigure_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "You don’t have to follow me all the time... Didn’t we make an appointment long ago? I will never leave alone again. No... It’s not that I don’t like you, it’s just that you are like this... I will lose the ability to think. ..."
 Shigure_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ah, you are here. What's the matter, don't you dare to approach them? Times have changed. We are no longer who we were. Look forward, after all, we... are not alone anymore. "
 Shigure_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "What are you looking at? Mystery... Is that the work of Mr. Edogawa Ranho? Well, I also like Mr. Edogawa's book. The description of human nature in it is unforgettable."
 Shigure_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "What are you doing in the kitchen? If you want to steal food, it's best to check the safety around first-wait, don't just put it in your mouth, I don't mean to report you..."
 Shigure_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I have no deeds worthy of boasting...no, there is still one thing-meeting, knowing, and falling in love with you. This is the only thing worth boasting about in my life so far."
 Shigure_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Senior, I got this from the doctor-it is said to reduce heavy smoke, I think you will be able to use it. Well, if I can help you, I am also very happy."
 Murasame_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hey~ Don't hide from me, I won't eat you... Ah, it seems to be very interesting, I changed my mind! Run away, if caught, I will "eat you" "You~"

 Murasame_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hmph, everything is in my calculations, it is only a matter of time before the admiral is captured. Such an innocent child, I like it the most~"
 Murasame_TouchDialog_4:0 "Admiral, I'm not going to bed at this late hour, can you tell me what you are looking forward to? For example-night attack? Huhu~ Even adults can't use these crooked brains~ and even if I want to attack at night You, you won't find it~"
 Murasame_TouchDialog_5:0 "Oh~ this is not the flagship of the Fourth Mines~ I'm hungry, can you give me some food? Um, you deserve to be the flagship, really an open-minded person~ If you need my help, just don’t hesitate Speak up and stand by at any time!"
 Murasame_TouchDialog_6:0 "I want to watch the magic you performed during the day again~ I want to be your only audience at this moment~ Huh? Because I like you, I want to monopolize you-forever~ Oh, blushing~ So cute~"
 Murasame_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "What should be done in the newlywed life~ First~ Go to a place where no one is there to relax and stay away from this disputed world. There, there are only you and me, and then-next is restricted content~ So Cut~"
 Murasame_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Puff haha~ I was fooled~ You thought of something outside the specification for a moment~ Haha, no one can stop my charm~"
 Murasame_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Our sisters completed the construction on the same day~ It's not too much to say that they are twins~ But the child is too thin, huh? I'm not shy at all~ Why don't you try it~"
 Murasame_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Love is like magic, full of unthinkable aura. Met and fell in love~The two who fell in love and grew old together~"
  Murasame_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The devil with horns and tail... sounds very interesting~ What do demons usually do? Unknown things are really exciting!"
 Murasame_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Do you snore when you fall asleep? I haven't heard the snoring sound. It should be very interesting, right? Boss, superintendent, adults, people-hurry up and fall asleep~ and snore~"
 Yuudachi_TouchDialog_1:0 "Well...it’s really a headache, why doesn’t Ayanami smile? Is it because my magic is not exciting enough? Then I have to do it! I must make Ayanami laugh! Can't make her Always keep a straight face~"
 Yuudachi_TouchDialog_2:0 "Oh! Hello, Admiral~ I'm on my way to the show. Would you like to come and see it together? The Shiro-class fourth ship-Yuudachi! The unique magic show in Minato, even if you miss it once, you will regret it. And oh~"
 Yuudachi_TouchDialog_3:0 "Why can Mura Yu say those shy words naturally every time..."I like you", is it so easy to say? No...impossible! I can't do it at Yuudachi Ah! Woo..."
 Yuudachi_TouchDialog_4:0 "Beep Beep Beep~ I received the admiral’s sorrowful radio wave. Is it because the night is too long and I feel bored? It doesn’t matter~ Please don’t blink next, Xili’s performance is about to begin~"
 Yuudachi_TouchDialog_5:0 "Huh? Why don’t you show your hands? What a rude question! As a first-class magic master, if you do some tricks with your hands, wouldn’t it be too shameful! So I chose the simplest way, It’s what it looks like now~ it’s perfect, isn’t it~"
 Yuudachi_TouchDialog_6:0 "Gurulu...ha! Thanks to the admiral for the gift~ the hot cocoa is so delicious! Well, I decided to give back to the enthusiastic admiral! Cangqiang! My homemade fruit jelly~ it's delicious! ~Try it soon~"

 Yuudachi_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The Admiral~ Close your eyes, don’t ask so much~ Surprise is not a surprise if you say it-well, open your eyes~ Qiang Qiang! Happy birthday to you!

 Yuudachi_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "At night, she will be a little bit excited, she is probably the same, right? Well, that kid always doesn't like to laugh, he will be more cute when he smiles. You can't keep your face straight, the admiral. The son will get old faster!"
 Arashi_TouchDialog_1:0 "I feel the breath of my sisters! I'll pass by now!"

 Arashi_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "My sense of direction is very reliable! No matter where you are, I can find you! If you don't believe me, why not come and play hide and seek!"
 Arashi_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It's called "home" when everyone gathers together and lively~ This family, no one can't lack it. You are the backbone of this family-at least I feel so~"
 Arashi_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Every time I get to the night, my back gets cold...what is it that I am staring at? Admiral, my back will be handed over to you! Let's get the suspicious person out! Let's go-- "

 Shimakaze_TouchDialog_5:0 "As long as you are with everyone, you won't feel lonely anymore!"
 Shimakaze_TouchDialog_6:0 "Admiral, are you finished? Will you play with me for a while?"
 Shimakaze_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Senior, let's be friends! Um...Senior, let's be my sister! I want sister! Please!"
 Shimakaze_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hehe, my turret is specially made, the only one in the port area~ Is it dazzling? I am a perfect destroyer, and the equipment is naturally the most perfect~"
 Shimakaze_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Admiral and Admiral~ Good morning! A new day is here! Where are you going to play today? Huh... Do you have to deal with official duties again? Sometimes you can take time to accompany me... Ooo..."
 Shimakaze_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Admiral, don't keep staring at the turret, it will make you dizzy. Huh? Is there something in it? Let me see... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uhhh! "

 Minekaze_TouchDialog_5:0 "Here... Wow! Mu... Mutsuki!? Why are you here!?"
 Minekaze_TouchDialog_6:0 "Wow... I don't understand at all... I'm sorry, I can't help..."
 Minekaze_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Everyone looks so strong... Only I can't help... If I can grow up quickly... Maybe I can help everyone!"
 Minekaze_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Admiral... Miss Shimakaze suddenly ran and asked me to be her sister... How should I reply to her... Can a humble person like me do it?"
 Minekaze_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "That...Island, Miss Shimakaze! Regarding your previous request, because...I'm very stupid, maybe I can't play the role of "sister"... Even so... is it okay?"
 Minekaze_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I always feel very happy, I was able to take this step bravely, and thanks to your encouragement. It's just that Shimakaze is so clingy... No, I'm not complimenting you, Shimakaze... "
 Minekaze_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Don't... don't go so fast, I can't keep up with you... Shimakaze, take a short rest... Don't you feel tired? I... I can't, please be considerate of my sister Bar……"
 Minekaze_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The body is so tired that she seems to fall apart... However, she, who has the same name as that child, is also a good boy. For her, I want to be more reliable... At least, I have to be a competent sister. ."
 Z17_TouchDialog_1:0 "Every time I walk on the road, I always feel that someone is following behind me. Is this my illusion?"
 Z17_TouchDialog_2:0 "I have been taught a lesson, why is the Cossack so arrogant!"
 Z17_TouchDialog_3:0 "When it comes to luck, sister Z20 is really lucky among our sisters."
 Z17_TouchDialog_4:0 "The radar seems to have found something... Sir, I'll take a look, and I'll be back soon."
 Z17_TouchDialog_5:0 "I feel like I have said something dangerous... I hope nothing will happen, ooh..."
 Z17_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sir! Help me! Miss Leipzig, I am not gold! Ah, ah, let go!!!"
 Z17_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The names of our Type Z destroyers are very long and hard to remember at all... Just like Hans's child, she can call no more than five names, alas... the code name is more concise and clear."
 Z17_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Aren't we too leisurely like this? I don't care, will you be gossiped? You don't have to be with me all the time. I'm not a kid, so I can take care of myself."
 Z17_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I envy sister Z1. As the eldest daughter of a big family, she can dedicate everything she has to her sisters... What a broad mind! I also want to become... For a moment, I feel my image collapsed. broken…"
 Z17_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Woo...the back is tingling...what the hell is it...ah, it's the Nuremberg instructor! Saved!"
  Z17_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Obviously she is a sister, but Miss Leipzig is a lot more frivolous than the Nuremberg instructor, she doesn't look like a sister at all. The ideal sister is probably like the Nuremberg instructor~"
 Z17_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh? Hans, why are you lying on the ground? You won't bump into something again... Ah, sure enough... Really, be careful, the skirt is dirty."
 Z18_TouchDialog_1:0 "Search and search, did the sir carry any gifts? Just hand them to me honestly...I will be very happy."
 Z18_TouchDialog_2:0 "Although it is an opponent, Firefly is really brave. It's the first time I have seen someone who can be so brave against Sister Hipper."
 Z18_TouchDialog_3:0 "Our sisters love to play hide-and-seek together, sir, do you want to play together?"
 Z18_TouchDialog_4:0 "Although hide-and-seek is very interesting, but it is too dark now, so don't play this...Ah! By the way, let me play target shooting! Sir's marksmanship, let me have a good experience!"
 Z18_TouchDialog_5:0 "Unexpectedly! Sir, you are really super strong! I will definitely win next time! Then the rest time is over, go to work~"
 Z18_TouchDialog_6:0 "How is the progress of the work~ Please don't look at me, I'm just here to supervise your work~ Gute Nacht~"
 Z18_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Isn't this the Leipzig instructor, why are you free to come here today... Hey? There are plans to let me join? But then again, why did you come to me specially?"
 Z18_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I always feel that the Leipzig instructor is playing tricks on me. In this age, how can there be any sailing warships... Not only that, but also give me a videotape. Forget it, just pass the time..."
 Z18_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sir~ Your marksmanship is getting better and better, do you practice secretly? You have worked so hard to defeat me, you are so cute!"
 Z18_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Miss Tirbitz, can I borrow a TV? The Leipzig instructor gave me a video tape, and said it was very beautiful... Hey, you are also interested? Let’s watch it together. It’s better to have someone with you. Hello~"
 Z18_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The Marvel is really-so handsome! The sailing warship is like a work of art! If possible, I would also like to get on the sailing warship to go to sea!"
 Z18_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The purpose of hitting a corner is like mounting a bayonet on a firearm? It can be most effective at close range, a desperate weapon! Ah, but now the battle is not needed at all, I just remember it. ~"
 Vampire_TouchDialog_1:0 "The tail behind, hee hee~ This is my military exploits-cherish these cute experimental products!"
 Vampire_TouchDialog_2:0 "The happiest moment in my life was when I was selected into the Z Fleet to escort my sister in the counterattack. For this reason, I will not relax in training!"
 Vampire_TouchDialog_3:0 "The same method can be used for both destruction and rescue. How to use it depends on my sister... No, it’s up to you! (Great reading)"
 Vampire_TouchDialog_4:0 "What kind of person everyone will become can be seen in blood, so, Commander, let me...see what kind of person you will become~"
 Vampire_TouchDialog_5:0 "When I was the most impoverished, it was my sister who counterattacked me and took me in. It was this as an opportunity to join the Z Fleet. As for being incorporated into the Far Eastern Navy, that is a long time ago..."
 Vampire_TouchDialog_6:0 "It's a good time to do research at night...Cut, is the commander sleepy so early? It's really not very useful..."

 Converse_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I think Clarkston's paintings are not exaggerated even if they are called "art". Because they are the epitome of the world that she has devoted all her efforts to portraying."
 Converse_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Meow~meow~meow~ are you there? Well, I brought food here again. Eat slowly, everyone has a share-ball ball... you're not a cat..."
 Converse_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I am not tired, thank you for your concern... After all, you can only see the stars at night."

 Dyson_TouchDialog_1:0 "Oh! I found a cute kid! Mutsuki~Ehhhhh?
 Dyson_TouchDialog_2:0 "Your Commander~ Is this bow tie very beautiful? Humph, this is Mr. President's reward! I am very powerful!"
 Dyson_TouchDialog_3:0 "I don't need Sister Fletcher to worry about it! Anyway, I am also a member of the "Little Beaver" squadron! If you keep treating me as a child, even the older sister will be angry!"
 Dyson_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sister Clarkston~ I made snacks so late, sister, I’m so happy! I really want to marry my sister to be a bride~ Hey, blushing~"
 Dyson_TouchDialog_5:0 "Since we want to win, we should make it as perfect as a textbook! Even if there is only "31 knots", it can't hinder our "Little Beaver" squadron!"

 Claxton_TouchDialog_2:0 "You don't need to pay much attention to what Dyson said, this child is just a nasty mouth. In fact, she is a very slender girl."
 Claxton_TouchDialog_3:0 "Fighting is just a trivial matter. As long as it is your order, our "Little Beaver" squadron will never fail. Especially me, this is not arrogance."
 Claxton_TouchDialog_4:0 "I really didn't expect Dyson to say that sentence... I caught my sister off guard. Does this feel like "deer bumping"?"
 Claxton_TouchDialog_5:0 "This is a snack specially made for you, and it contains my deep love-eh? Obviously without alcohol, why are you blushing?"
 Claxton_TouchDialog_6:0 "It's already this time. If you don't go to rest anymore, what can you do if you are tired... Please rest for me, and leave the rest of the work to me."

 SamuelBRoberts_TouchDialog_3:0 "If you encounter cruisers or battleships, just run away, don't confront head-on...Just like this, is it all right? Somewhat unwilling to say."
 SamuelBRoberts_TouchDialog_4:0 "Many people say that Johnston is a young lady who is greedy for life and fear of death, but I always feel that there is a powerful force in her heart, so don't underestimate her..."

 Johnston_TouchDialog_3:0 "Samuel, you... when can you run so fast!"
  Johnston_TouchDialog_4:0 "If you face the enemy's overwhelming advantage, what should you do at that moment? Well, it's really worth thinking about...Haha, kidding, I'm so greedy for life and fear of death, I will definitely come back, don't worry."
 Johnston_TouchDialog_5:0 "If there is any work that needs to organize the materials, I don't need to find me. I'm not good at these, um... I will help you to call Hoel over!"
 Johnston_TouchDialog_6:0 "If you can get the tribute of the enemy in battle, this must be a great achievement."
 Johnston_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey, it's a rare time to be serious, but since then it has become the focus of everyone's attention. It's a headache, I don't have a chance to be lazy..."

 Johnston_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Samuel! Hoel! Let's go! Let's call Hillman to go out together~! Commander, you can't join, this is the secret gathering of Tafee III~!"
 Johnston_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It hurts... Commander, you light it up... Haha, who knows the firepower of those guys is so fierce, I'm a little slow to react, forgive me"
 Johnston_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hey, Commander, I suddenly want to hear the story of the seniors, can you tell me?"
 Johnston_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "A night without missions, wars, and work is really comfortable. What do you think?"
 Gremyashchiy_TouchDialog_1:0 "I modified the radar antenna that my friend from the west gave me. Now the antenna allows me to gain power from thunder and lightning (seriously)."
 Gremyashchiy_TouchDialog_2:0 "I know all kinds of weapons well. When I'm bored, I will disassemble the 130mm main gun blindfolded."
 Gremyashchiy_TouchDialog_3:0 "This shiny medal is a souvenir from a friend from the west."
 Gremyashchiy_TouchDialog_4:0 "Would you like a bite? The hot taste can drive away the chill of the ice sea."
 Gremyashchiy_TouchDialog_5:0 "Huh...? (tilt head) Bo, Bo, Bo..."
 Gremyashchiy_TouchDialog_6:0 "Hold your breath and listen. I can see many different sounds."
 Gremyashchiy_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Want to have a good morning hug? Here are some rubles. Go buy a good hot water bottle."
 Gremyashchiy_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The enemy in this mission is very strong, but don't worry, I will protect you."
 Gremyashchiy_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "In order to better protect all these things I love, I want to strengthen training."
 Gremyashchiy_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Broken your finger? Give me your hand, ah ooh (hold your finger)"
 Gremyashchiy_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Because I am very timid, really (emphasis), so I must not leave me in one step (hold on)"
 Gremyashchiy_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "My antenna sensor is very sensitive, my dear, I know all the fluctuations in your heart."
 U81_TouchDialog_1:0 "Sir, is there anything else I need to explain? If not, I will dive in (Guru Guru)"
 U81_TouchDialog_2:0 "Training or something, as long as you listen to the predecessors, you are right."
 U81_TouchDialog_3:0 "Berg! Berg! Strange, I don't know where to go to get some sun... Obviously it's time for diving training."
 U81_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sir, the flowers in the office are not happy today, you have to water them in time~"
 U81_TouchDialog_5:0 "Actually, the scenery under the sea is very good, sir, if you can give me a camera..."
 U81_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sir, please work hard. I will use my paintings to record your story."
 U81_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "You have to learn to communicate with these three little guys, and become friends with them, so that they will take the initiative to protect you when fighting~!"
 U81_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ah-Berg doesn't know where to go lazily. It's a headache. Can you help me find it? At least you should sleep beside me when you sleep..."
 U81_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Miss Royal Ark, I can understand that you were unconvinced after losing to me, how about it? Do you want to do it again? I won't run away if I win."
 U81_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The flower is also emotional, I like to talk to this flower when I'm fine. Now you can come and accompany her together, then, here is where we will meet every night~"
 U81_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Wait until the next pay...should be able to buy a diving gear for the chief! Just save money...well! I can do it! In order to...in order to complete the agreement with the chief!"
 U81_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "A little bit reluctant to be separated from the chief... But this is also to better protect the chief... I'm leaving!"
 U96_TouchDialog_1:0 "Every prey is valuable. When hunting, you must never pick and choose."
 U96_TouchDialog_2:0 "A good hunter must be good at timing. If the timing is perfect, I will do it even in the daytime."
 U96_TouchDialog_3:0 "Senior U47... She is my goal. One day, I will surpass her."
 U96_TouchDialog_4:0 "Callit’s about to leave the port, bring canned fruits, oranges, apples, lemons... well, you’re ready, let’s go!"
 U96_TouchDialog_5:0 "At night, it's time for the prey to relax...As a hunter, I have to start working."
  U96_TouchDialog_6:0 "Although the younger generations of the 22nd and 24th Fleet are still immature, they will have strong combat effectiveness if they are trained."
 U96_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Warrior Glory? Chivalry? It's just a fig leaf for the weak to talk about masturbation. History is always written for the winners, so I only pursue victory."
 U96_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "U-boats can only be called a wolf pack when they are together... Although Senior U47 always said that, she herself is a lone wolf."
 U96_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The battle itself is the weak and the strong, and the winner survives. Respect every prey and hunt it down. This is my job as a hunter."
 U96_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "They are already my prey, and they are so dishonest. I will ignore you..."
 U96_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Every time I dive into the depths of the sea, there is nothing in front of me. All I can do is miss you... After all, you are my most boastful prey."
 U96_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "My hairpin...this is a sawfish, not a swordfish! Don't you think...it's cute?"
 U156_TouchDialog_1:0 "He is the greatest hero, the Iron Cross, he deserves it."
 U156_TouchDialog_2:0 "My strength? I think... When I leave the port, I'll see it."
 U156_TouchDialog_3:0 "When any U-boat is ordered, it is not far from death...Of course, Senior U47 is an exception."
 U156_TouchDialog_4:0 "If possible, I would like to make an agreement with each enemy. After peace, everyone will put down their weapons and be friends..."
 U156_TouchDialog_5:0 "No matter when, never forget the respect for life."
 U156_TouchDialog_6:0 "I can forgive the reckless pilots that day, because I have my reasons, and they also have their own difficulties."
 U156_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The wolf pack tactic is an excellent invention and a genius concept. I can't deny the results of this tactic, but I can't agree with some of the methods. Therefore, I will stick to my own ideas and act."
 U156_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "U47, I don't mind comparing you with who is the real ace submarine. However, these are meaningless to me, and the same to you."
 U156_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sir, do you need an breakfast? Or, it's time for lunch."
 U156_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I have never regretted what I did. After all, I followed my heart and made the right choice."
 U156_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Sir, after the war, I want to show you someone. I don't know where she is or how she is now... Ah, we are friends, but we have only one side."
 U156_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Are you okay? Sir. Seeing that you are a little tired, can I help you go back to rest?"
 U1206_TouchDialog_1:0 "For the sake of convenience, my ship's installation is fully automatic. You see, if you want to start, you only need to press...press...hey? Which button is it..."
 U1206_TouchDialog_2:0 "Launch a torpedo!...Ahhh, I made a mistake, why did I start backing up, stop! Stop it!"
 U1206_TouchDialog_3:0 "The predecessors of U-boats are already outstanding, but I will definitely surpass them in the future!"
 U1206_TouchDialog_4:0 "This button is to control this place, and then... Ah, it's so difficult, why is high technology so troublesome!"
 U1206_TouchDialog_5:0 "Diving begins... wait a minute, forgot to open...cough cough, bad, almost died..."
 U1206_TouchDialog_6:0 "You can lose your horse, you know you are not blessed...what does such a circumstantial sentence mean!...No, it's a good thing to fall off the horse!"
 U1206_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "It's breakfast time! Charge to the dining room!... Hey? Why is no one cooking, sir, shouldn't you cook for me?"
 U1206_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ready to go to sea... ah? Sir, you do... Ah! Don't mess with my things... check? Check what? I don't have... Ah, these things, I didn’t put them, no !"
 U1206_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Do you want me to be more careful when fighting? Don't worry, I will be fine. Although it seems that I haven't mastered it yet, one day, I will fully master it!"
 U1206_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Obviously just a humble little guy, why is U1405 so poisonous, even if I am not as good as her, don't call me a fool... Sir, I am not a fool, am I?!"
 U1206_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The three little wolves of U81 are so cute, hehe, next time you use fresh food to trick Berg over!"
 U1206_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Hey--ha! I finally found the right way to use it. Although it took a lot of time, it's a great improvement. From now on, you can... Moving again, stop, stop!"
 Tang_TouchDialog_1:0 "Lighting up your torpedo every time you cruise is a symbol of glory for the submarine."
 Tang_TouchDialog_2:0 "In addition to sinking the opponent, rescuing teammates is also a necessary task."
  Tang_TouchDialog_3:0 "Although people like to talk about the achievements of the mackerel and the archer, no one can compare to me when it comes to the tonnage of the results."
 Tang_TouchDialog_4:0 "If you wish, Commander, would you like to hear about my new results on this sailing?"
 Tang_TouchDialog_5:0 "I cannot tolerate any enemy running away from under my nose, nor can I tolerate any partner leaving in front of me."

 GeorgiosAverof_TouchDialog_1:0 "Why call me Satan... To be honest, I don't like it very much. But on the battlefield, this title can make the enemy feel scared, so... Although it is a little uncomfortable, it is fine to call myself this occasionally..."
 GeorgiosAverof_TouchDialog_2:0 "Naval battles are never determined by the parameters on paper. Weapons are dead but people are alive. How to use your own advantages will change the situation of the battle."
 GeorgiosAverof_TouchDialog_3:0 "Although I can't keep up with the times, I still have the power to fight. If you need me, please don't hesitate."
 GeorgiosAverof_TouchDialog_4:0 "In the old mythology, Satan is a hermaphrodite fallen angel, but in his paintings, there are few female appearance images...Ah, what am I like in the eyes of the Turkish people! "
 GeorgiosAverof_TouchDialog_5:0 "The little guy Ai Li... is still so willful, unwilling to accept her name, unwilling to accept her identity... However, Feihong is also a handsome name, I don't know if it has any deep meaning."
 GeorgiosAverof_TouchDialog_6:0 "In the era of peace, the Olympiad will be held every four years. Therefore, the Olympic flame is called a symbol of peace and tolerance.

 GeorgiosAverof_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Geben... not reconciled? Obviously you are the one known as the legend, but you have never defeated the ordinary me. Now I give you a chance to challenge me. How about? Dare?"
 GeorgiosAverof_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "There is no difference between a brutal ruler and a barbarian who dominates wild beasts. All force and hegemony will die out with the change of times. Only art and culture will be more dazzling during this journey."
 GeorgiosAverof_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It's hard work, this is the Greek yogurt that I just made. Would you like to try it? Only one bite~"

 Sukhbaatar_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey! Hey! Wake up General, you wake up! Only you and I are still idle in the entire port area and nothing has been done!"
 Sukhbaatar_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "General, I'm going to sail, what do you want for dinner tonight? Hey, I can catch fish as long as it is fish~! But the job of cooking is left to you!"
 Sukhbaatar_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hey! How can anyone in this world refuse to let go fishing, it is too bad!"

 JeannedArc_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The fire took away many innocent lives and made me see the world clearly. Therefore, I stood up-for the people to no longer suffer the suffering of war, for the world to return to its original Looks like."
 JeannedArc_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "My lord, you should rest. Yes, I will be by your side-after all, this is an oath that has been made since the day of meeting. Good night, my lord-my love... "
 KingGeorgeV_TouchDialog_1:0 "Is there anything? If you have something to discuss, please speak up. If it's okay... I am going to go out for a walk."
 KingGeorgeV_TouchDialog_2:0 "Swordsmanship is getting better and better, Duke of York, even if I only take you out of the house, I feel very relieved."
 KingGeorgeV_TouchDialog_3:0 "The king's world... is it a realm that only people who only know how to fight can understand, whether it is Richelieu, Bismarck, or even Veneto... They can only be called excellent fighters."
 KingGeorgeV_TouchDialog_4:0 "Obviously you can be friends, why should you be enemies... Don’t you think this sentence is too ridiculous? The person who says this sentence is not qualified to be a king, at most... just a knight living in his own fantasy. ."
 KingGeorgeV_TouchDialog_5:0 "When the sun rises, it sets, history is nothing but the harmony of chaos and law. As a monarch... I already knew this."
 KingGeorgeV_TouchDialog_6:0 "Weak people will always regard things they can't understand as ghosts and gods, but what can even the strong do? Above the waves of history, they are just authorities. Even if they know all this, Can't change the final outcome...Wales, drink this glass of wine and stop lamenting reality, how?"
 KingGeorgeV_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The king is not an authority established by battle, but by every action and word and deed in life. Therefore, from today on, I will find someone to be responsible for training all your etiquette, please study carefully."
 KingGeorgeV_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Isn't this a guard? Where did you go to play recently? I know you are also a brave... Have you found new treasures, such as... rare stamps?"
 KingGeorgeV_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "If you want to go on a long journey, please tell me one hour in advance, I hope I can change to a more convenient dress to go out... After all, I am by your side and want to be your partner, not the monarch. "
 KingGeorgeV_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "A large port area, does no one like stamp collecting? Such a historically engraved thing is the most precious thing in the world... Commander, don't touch this, this royal penny... is priceless."
 KingGeorgeV_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It is a very dangerous thing to let others know the preferences of the person in the throne, because people will let go of their guards and make wrong judgments when facing the things they like. This is the great taboo of the king. ."
 KingGeorgeV_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Headache, so tired... Commander, close the door, yes, lock it up, I don't want to see anyone, I don't want to be the perfect monarch in their hearts... Hey, take a drink with me."
 Barfleur_TouchDialog_1:0 "Who said that a destroyer can only launch torpedoes, as long as the ship is equipped with a reasonable plan, even a destroyer can develop in an all-round way."
 Barfleur_TouchDialog_2:0 "Battle-level sisters, but only I have witnessed the defeat of the enemy~"
 Barfleur_TouchDialog_3:0 "Daily training work is really busy, whether it is anti-submarine, anti-aircraft, shelling, torpedo...the same cannot be less..."
 Barfleur_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, let me see you as I passed by~ Huh? Haven't finished the work yet? It seems that it would be impossible without my help."
 Barfleur_TouchDialog_5:0 "If I work harder, my sisters shouldn't have to participate in the battle!"
 Barfleur_TouchDialog_6:0 "The current peace is obtained by the efforts of the seniors on the battlefield, and the future peace will depend on me."
 Barfleur_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "No matter where you go, you must open an umbrella for a lady to be a qualified partner. Remember? Don't forget it next time."
 Barfleur_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Before I came to the port area, I had a fate with Miss Missouri. I did not expect to meet again here. I can attract such an outstanding woman to you. You are an excellent in every sense. Commander of ah~!"
 Barfleur_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "What did you just say?...Want to see me launch a torpedo? Ahem...Even if you and I are already close, it would be rude to say this! Commander!"
 Barfleur_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It is the night in the port area that makes me feel more at ease. There are stars in the sky, everyone who loves each other, and you are gentle... Maybe this is my real home."
 Barfleur_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "When I'm fine, I like to listen to Senior Belfast's performance. There is a special sense of heaviness in her music, which makes people particularly reassuring. Will you accompany me next time? Seniors hope very much. Someone can listen to her performance."
 Barfleur_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The brewing method of black tea is very complicated. However, it will take a long time to teach you a little bit. As long as you are still by my side, you are still willing to taste black tea with me~"
 Vestal_TouchDialog_1:0 "Miss Enterprise is injured again?...Just leave it to me, I can't know how to treat her better~"
 Vestal_TouchDialog_2:0 "Hey hey hey, everyone should be careful when training... Hey, I'm almost too busy to come."
 Vestal_TouchDialog_3:0 "Huh? You are here, great, please help me carry some supplies for repairs... Don't worry, there are not many."
 Vestal_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, please don't do anything just fine, I am a female kitchen god, and I cannot tolerate such frivolous behavior, given the name of Hestia by people!"
 Vestal_TouchDialog_5:0 "Commander, this is the list of repair supplies needed recently...Hey, what is your expression, don't be surprised, this is just a small part."
 Vestal_TouchDialog_6:0 "The night without work is really refreshing. I can finally rest for a while."
 Vestal_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey, it's dawn, and a busy day is about to begin again... I really envy people who can sleep in..."
 Vestal_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Miss South Dakota and Miss Washington, if you two fight again, I will invite the two young ladies from Enterprise and North Carolina to be the audience. Do you hear that?"
 Vestal_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hey? Give it to me? Thanks. But, would you like to think about the thing I said last time about learning to repair ship equipment...Oh, don't go!"
 Vestal_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Although I used to have strict requirements for you, you don't have to be so shy, come on, let me borrow your shoulders, let me take a break..."
 Vestal_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Miss Enterprise, please stop being so impulsive next time. Although I know you want to win every battle, I cannot guarantee that your luck will be so good every time..."
 Vestal_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Hoo-I'm busy, really-hey? Haven't you finished your work? It's rare that you are so diligent, how can you do without rewards, wait a minute, the special nutritious desserts made by the kitchen god will be ready soon Alright!"
 Gotland_TouchDialog_1:0 "Oh...has it been discovered by the commander? Hush...Don't speak, I'm investigating the reason why ginger and fish cakes often disappear inexplicably, and it's over when Miss Hood finds out that I'm stalking her."
 Gotland_TouchDialog_2:0 "An aviation cruiser that has both the ability to pin and suppress the enemy in the air and the ability to fight on the water-this is my lady, and I will not show mercy to your subordinates in training."
 Gotland_TouchDialog_3:0 "I am not going to be silly and face-to-face with an enemy stronger than myself. If you are in danger, asking someone for help is definitely the best solution."
 Gotland_TouchDialog_4:0 "Miss Bismarck always seems to be avoiding me, but... hehe, do you want the commander to know where she goes to drink every night? Give me something to tell you."
 Gotland_TouchDialog_5:0 "Hey hey, I discovered the laziness of the commander again...hehe, if you don't want me to say it, please please me~"
 Gotland_TouchDialog_6:0 "The coastline guarded by Sv national sisters is really reassuring."
  Gotland_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hehe, want to read my logbook? There are many secrets in it~ If it doesn't give me enough benefits, I won't give it to you~!"
 Gotland_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Steps lightly... Don't make too much movement, cats can easily be frightened... Ah-I was discovered by Oscar, Commander, run!"
 Gotland_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Do you want to camp in the forest tonight? Bring sleeping bags, let’s go!"
 Gotland_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Did you date other beautiful ladies during the day? Really not?... Hee hee, don't be so scared, your every move is under my eyes~"
 Gotland_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Let me go out! I'm going to see where Miss Bismarck is going tonight... Hey?! Bi, Miss Bismarck, when did you arrive... Hey, I didn't say anything, I didn't say... "
 Gotland_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The relationship between Bismarck and Miss Hood is actually not as bad as we thought..."
 Novgorod_TouchDialog_1:0 "Gray people, my slowness is not because of my high resistance, but because of my graceful posture."
 Novgorod_TouchDialog_2:0 "Give me a new dress? It looks pretty, so as a reward, I will teach you some more interesting content today."
 Novgorod_TouchDialog_3:0 "Oh, I have seen a lot of people like you. Don't worry, as long as you study with me, you will definitely understand the beauty of a girl."
 Novgorod_TouchDialog_4:0 "Oh oh oh, envy my elegant dance, do you want me to show compassion and teach you to waltz?"
 Novgorod_TouchDialog_5:0 "It's really rude. I took the opportunity to hold this lady's hand directly. But you did a good job."
 Novgorod_TouchDialog_6:0 "No one was dancing with me before. Although your dancing is still a little clumsy...Does your feet still hurt?"
 Novgorod_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "General, our dance steps are getting more and more in line with each other~"
 Novgorod_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The weather is good today, let's go for a walk together, but you have to hold my hand tight, huh? I'm afraid you will fall, General."
 Novgorod_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Ouch (falling down), am I a little slow? What, can you pick me up often? What should I do when dancing?"
 Novgorod_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The water of the Volga River flows quietly, alright, have you laughed enough, don’t you give me a hand if you know I’m slow."
 Novgorod_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It's a bit steep here, hold my hand, oops (falling down together), then just roll around together."
 Novgorod_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It feels hot on your face, your breathing. I...you... (eyes closed)"
 Cushing_TouchDialog_1:0 "Huh-today's training is over, the result is... hey, what to do with these, think about what to eat next is the point."
 Cushing_TouchDialog_2:0 "Mahan, come on, today we have a showdown and see who is faster!"
 Cushing_TouchDialog_3:0 "Aiming is complete, request shelling-hey, how about people? I still said when I was aiming..."
 Cushing_TouchDialog_4:0 "What interesting things will happen at night? I won't know if I don't see it with my own eyes. Hmm~um~"
 Cushing_TouchDialog_5:0 "I had a nightmare. I dreamed that Mahan turned into a mecha and then destroyed this place...Ahhh, it feels terrible to think about it!"
 Cushing_TouchDialog_6:0 "Atlanta! Atlanta! Hey, strange, where did that guy go, saying he was going to patrol together, hey, what a headache..."
 Cushing_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Commander, you are awake, come and help me! Asia and Atlanta just fell asleep directly after the exercise! I dragged her back by myself! ...whoop, so tired "
 Cushing_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Huh-a battleship artillery is better than what I can be proud of. If it weren't for the few torpedo mistakes, how could I... Humph, there are many times, only six times, only six times!"
 Cushing_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "In the daytime, my own advantage in finding the enemy can't be reflected at all...then I can only stay by your side and sleep, hehe~"
 Cushing_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Commander, do you want to go out and explore with me? The ocean at night is beautiful!"
 Cushing_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Atlanta always likes to take responsibility alone. Although she always smiles and brings joy to everyone, but her own responsibility is too heavy. Commander, would you like to help her with me? "
 Cushing_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Atlanta told me that as long as you listen with your heart, you can feel the other person's voice even without speaking. Let me try it... Well-um-wow! I heard it! Long live the commander's heart. I really care about Cushing, and I want to take Cushing to French Dip tomorrow!"
 Guadalcanal_TouchDialog_1:0 "Everyone, hurry up and train! There is not much time on the battlefield for us to learn the forgotten knowledge."
 Guadalcanal_TouchDialog_2:0 "Ahh
 Guadalcanal_TouchDialog_3:0 "When passing through a narrow place, you can't touch the ship's equipment, absolutely can't...ah, failed again...I am still too nervous, so let me add some training today."
 Guadalcanal_TouchDialog_4:0 "Today I also made a lot of mistakes, then in tomorrow's training, we must work hard to overcome them. Trust me, Commander, every day I will bring a brand new self."
 Guadalcanal_TouchDialog_5:0 "When dealing with submarines...will it be more advantageous at night? Although it is a bit difficult from the current equipment, I think it should be fine with training."
 Guadalcanal_TouchDialog_6:0 "U505 is a little different from the rest of the submarines. It always stays alone in silence. Hehe~ It might be a very cute child. I really want to hug her."
 Guadalcanal_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hee hee~ come to see me for training again? Always follow me so much, but it will delay your own work... OK, then you have a rest, but then you have to work hard! When I finish my work Go back, you will be rewarded for hard work~"
 Guadalcanal_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "This time, it must be... it's almost... Yeah! It's a success! Hey, did you see it, Commander? This is the first success, but it will continue to succeed in the future... to celebrate this time. At the beginning, I want to drink some iced coconut milk tonight, hehe!"
 Guadalcanal_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Take a rest today, how about going to the beach and surfing together?... Hee hee, won't you? Don't be afraid, I will teach you."
 Guadalcanal_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The so-called ship mother cannot escape the fate of sinking the enemy and being sunk by the enemy. Of course, whether we become the former or the latter depends on what we learn now and what we will do in the future. So...my Everything is left to you, my favorite commander~!"
 Guadalcanal_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Since I came to you, life seems to have changed a lot... Although I am not the strongest, but with you, everything goes smoothly. Hehe, what reward do you want? Woolen cloth?"
 Guadalcanal_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Commander, I am making some plans about the goals I want to achieve in the future. Do you want to be together?... Sit down and see, many of them are related to you. This is our common future. "
 Nurnberg_TouchDialog_1:0 "If you have any difficulties, please tell me. As an instructor, my duty is to solve your problems. It is a very happy thing to assist you in your growth."
 Nurnberg_TouchDialog_2:0 "Emden? It's really you~ I didn't expect to meet again here. I have something to say to you... well, go over there and sit down and talk slowly."
 Nurnberg_TouchDialog_3:0 "Along the way, I have witnessed many incidents. I have recorded all of this in this book. Would you like to hear me tell the stories of the past? For example-Bismarck's launch day ?"
 Nurnberg_TouchDialog_4:0 "Huh, today's training ends here, everyone has worked hard. On the way back, you must go together, pay attention to safety~ um...I should rest for a while, and there will be other things to deal with later. "
 Nurnberg_TouchDialog_5:0 "Why is there still light here... Tirbitz! How many times is this? My sister must have told you not to play games at night, right? Okay, go to bed, and continue like this. It's not tall!"
 Nurnberg_TouchDialog_6:0 "Personal interest? When you say that, I don't seem to have any interest of my own... But, as long as I can watch those children thrive, I will be very happy."
  Nurnberg_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hmm... I always think something is missing? Sir, you haveah, remembered this morning. "Good morning"this is what I forgot. Haha, you don't think I'm a bit rigid, right? It’s fine if you don’t, if you are hated...I’ll be very sad."
 Nurnberg_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Those children grow up to be their ideal selves, and despite paying too much, everything is worth it. This is lifea cruel but beautiful life."
 Nurnberg_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The only thing I can't let go of is you. I really want time to stop here forever. Thisyour embrace is still so warm...Hey, I won't be able to say those frustrating words like this. ...Hold me more...just a while..."
 Nurnberg_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Since I met you, I realized that those fairy tales are not "fairy tales". You and I who live in this world have been drawn together by an invisible destiny. Every day I live with you is my life The most beautiful day in China."
 Nurnberg_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "You are having a hard time at work. Would you like to have a supper? You always say that everything is good, so I just made a portion of each dish... It turned out like this in retrospect... Call more people to come, haha."
 Nurnberg_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Go to sleep, sleep with the stars. Tomorrow, it must be a calm day."
 Ajax_TouchDialog_1:0 "We have three people, and the other has only one person. How can we lose! It's impossible to lose! Let's go, Exeter!"
 Ajax_TouchDialog_2:0 "Commander, where are you going? I will see you off."
 Ajax_TouchDialog_3:0 "There are always people who don't follow the rules, so annoying..."
 Ajax_TouchDialog_4:0 "If one person can't beat him, he will call two, if two fails, then three... In short, fighting this kind of thing, as long as you can win it!"
 Ajax_TouchDialog_5:0 "Hey hey hey! The people over there stop me. It is dangerous to leave the port at night. You come back to me. No sailing is prohibited without the commander's order!"
 Ajax_TouchDialog_6:0 "What should I do if I walk alone at night and get attacked or attacked..."
 Ajax_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Get up, I have to send you to the office before I can train with peace of mind!... Hey, don't think I don't know you want to be lazy!"
 Ajax_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Commander, come~have a smile~ Hey, be happy, don't frown, it's not good-looking -!"
 Ajax_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hey, Hey, Spey, do me a favor, that... the commander will come to see the exercise in a while, can you, can you put some water in... Let me win, this one!"
 Ajax_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Interacting with business people can learn a lot of interesting knowledge. If I have the opportunity in the future, I also want to be a businessman traveling around the world. Hey, do you want to be together?"
 Ajax_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "If you are bullied, tell me, I will protect you! The premise... is that I can play, hehe..."
 Ajax_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "HuhEarl Spey is such a good man! Let's invite her to dinner next time!"
 GotaLejon_TouchDialog_1:0 "Cut-training is really boring, I can't feel the pleasure of wandering on the border of life and death at all, Commander, when is the next attack?"
 GotaLejon_TouchDialog_2:0 "Just sing the praises of death and life, hum...Death metal is not so superficial, wait, I will be able to write the most shocking lyrics!"
 GotaLejon_TouchDialog_3:0 "What? Do you have the habit of drinking black tea in the port area in the afternoon?...Grumbling--haha, it's too light, I still like to drink S country drinks!"
 GotaLejon_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hathe music played by those from the E country is so soft and weak, but the two sisters from the U country are a bit interesting, but they are almost compared to me."
 GotaLejon_TouchDialog_5:0 "I thought of a few great lyrics when I went to bed this afternoon, but I forgot when I woke up, ah-it's a pity, next time you must remember to keep both paper and pen by your side."
 GotaLejon_TouchDialog_6:0 "Don't always be bound by these rules, work, and so on. Break these things, and you will see more and broader worlds!"
 GotaLejon_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Commander, you are awake, I just wrote a song, would you like to listen to it?"
 GotaLejon_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I just seemed to hear the sound of your heart... well, it sounds beautiful, it seems very suitable for making a song. Please don't move, don't talk! I'm about to start writing!"
 GotaLejon_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Ah-so boring! How about an alcoholic drink? It's refreshing!"
 GotaLejon_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The quiet night, let me break it with singing!...Oh! Commander, don't grab me, can't I stop playing...I, I, I know I was wrong!!"
  GotaLejon_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The ocean at night and the ocean during the day must not be the same world. Hey, thinking about it this way makes me even more excited!"
 GotaLejon_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Hair? Huh-it's handsome! This is the color that symbolizes my music... Don't show this expression, music has color and soul, and it all depends on the player's heart. "
 Yoizuki_TouchDialog_1:0 "Uh...hhhh, admiral, can you help me pick up that starfish? Thank you~ you are so kind."
 Yoizuki_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sister Qiuyue! Ah, Sister Liangyue is here too! Great... I'm still a little worried about how to get along with other people. My sisters are here, so I don't have anything to worry about... Ah, this sentence The words are a little bit bad..."
 Yoizuki_TouchDialog_3:0 "There is a reason for my appearance. Generally speaking, the battle was over before the repair was completed. And I was left aside before I completed the repair work. No one cares...oh, I Is it a bit too inexistent..."
 Yoizuki_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's dark...Huh? I, I am not scared? I just want to see the stars here! No, don't care!"
 Yoizuki_TouchDialog_5:0 "Hey-the anchoring job is completed, where do I go to see next? Ah, admiral, good evening~ eh? I am not a stone, of course I can walk around... You wouldn't think I was welded Did you die on that pedestal...?"
 Yoizuki_TouchDialog_6:0 "Uhhhhh~ The snacks that Sister Ryotsuki gave me should be kept well. Such a beautiful snack, isn't it a pity to eat it~"
 Yoizuki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The relationship between Sister Qiuyue and Sister Liangyue is really good... Both are so strong and so cute... Ahem, admiral, you are here... This is a normal relationship between sisters, please don't think about it! I like it! Only the admiral is thereahhhhh!!!
 Yoizuki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ah, eraser! Really, it will always be thrown away accidentally... It's not easy to pick up. Huh? Xiaoba! Help me pick up the eraser~ Thank you~ I'll make you a pudding later Oh~"
 Yoizuki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It is unforgettable to be able to see the heroic attitude of Miss Yamato when she attacked at close range... If it weren't for the work of air defense at the time, I really want to paint her posture for collection."
 Yoizuki_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Oh! What did you hit or hit!? Miss wearing a hat?! Are you okay! Eh...why do you want to observe this base? It's not a very precious thing... Hey! Why use a knife to scratch Ah!?"
 Yoizuki_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huh? Why is this carrier-based aircraft lying on the groundit’s too big!? Let me see...it’s called "Tianhe"? It should be Miss Shinano’s carrier-based aircraft, but... why There are so many snacks in the cockpit..."
 Yoizuki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "...nice scene, let's draw it. Under the faint candlelight, the admiral's sleeping face. It looks so happy...I also...I feel so happy."
 Minsk_TouchDialog_1:0 "This is life, comrade, this is life."
 Minsk_TouchDialog_2:0 "The construction of the port area is in full swing, which is great."
 Minsk_TouchDialog_3:0 "Although Tashkent is fast, but the tonnage is a bit big, I am fast and flexible."
 Minsk_TouchDialog_4:0 ""The cranberry flowers are blooming by the small river in the field. There is a person who makes me really love, but I can't tell if I am full of words. "Ah!? Commander, you, why are you here?!"
 Minsk_TouchDialog_5:0 "They are also destroyer leaders, how can I surpass Tashkent (thinking)."
 Minsk_TouchDialog_6:0 "Comrade Commander, you can't underestimate the destroyer, they are cavalry at sea, and the night is as fierce as a leopard."
 Minsk_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "My dear, are you free now? You will know what's going on when you lean over. (Leaps to your back) Haha, drive! The horse runs."
 Minsk_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Well, can you accompany me to see the fireworks? Okay, accompany me, otherwise I can only stun you with shells."
 Minsk_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I am very active again at sea today, leaving other people far behind, but I am tired, dear, help me squeeze my feet."
 Minsk_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Drink too much? Just...no, I will continue to drink, eh?! Put me down, don't grab my strap and lift me up!"
 Minsk_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Really? Wearing this shy tights can speed up? Huh, wearing hair accessories, won't that increase resistance? Honey, are you uncomfortable? Why do you breathe so intensely? "

 M2_TouchDialog_5:0 "You can't just open fire at night, that will expose your position! Launching torpedoes is the most romantic thing at night!"
 M2_TouchDialog_6:0 "Woo-should it be better to improve one's strength by heart?"
 M2_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey hey, the torpedoes and artillery are ready and ready to go! There are not many warriors as versatile as me!"

 Moltke_TouchDialog_1:0 "Sir Lu Zuo, this is my training plan for today. I don't know if you can give me some advice... I want to be as good as you."
 Moltke_TouchDialog_2:0 "Huh? The shell's landing location does not match the calculation result...Is it my negligence? No, if there is such a mistake on the battlefield, it will be finished..."
 Moltke_TouchDialog_3:0 "I was able to defeat Chief Lu Zuo... War exhaustion is really an opponent not to be underestimated."
 Moltke_TouchDialog_4:0 "I heard that Goben is very famous in various port areas? What do you think is a wonderful sister?"
 Moltke_TouchDialog_5:0 "Although actual combat experience is very important, the research and study of military theory must not be underestimated."
 Moltke_TouchDialog_6:0 "The storage, polishing and use of the sword are equally important. If you ignore any of these links, you will not be able to win the final victory."
 Moltke_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Slimness is indeed my disadvantage, but if I look down on me because of this, it will suffer."
 Moltke_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Strategy and tactics are really the most beautiful elements in the art of war."
 Moltke_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "This flower...for me? Haha, it's really beautiful, but it's not suitable for cruel battlefields."
 Moltke_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "A night snack for me? Thank you, sir. But this kind of cooking is too casual, so let’s not take it as an example."
 Moltke_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Goddess of Luck will only take care of the superior. Therefore, you and I have to work harder."
 Moltke_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I love this port area, and I will use my best methods to maintain the survival, independence and dignity of this port area."
 Indomitable_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hey?! I'll just make tea for a while, and the counterattack and the Prince of Wales are gone, um...really, why are you so anxious...act like this, but you will suffer."
 Indomitable_TouchDialog_2:0 "The real flowers are beautiful, but they are too fragile. Flowers made of metal are more reliable."
 Indomitable_TouchDialog_3:0 "Precise planning allows you to do things calmly, even in the face of danger, without the slightest panic."
 Indomitable_TouchDialog_4:0 "The advantage of an armored aircraft carrier is that it can withstand strong damage to the deck... As for Miss Dafeng, hehe... Isn't it normal that the half-hanging armor coverage level is penetrated?"
 Indomitable_TouchDialog_5:0 "Alerts, calculations, and information transmission are given to these sophisticated instruments. We only need to make a cup of tea and wait for them to do everything."
 Indomitable_TouchDialog_6:0 "Big mackerel, go out to the sea to help me see if there are any enemies!...Huh? Is there any strange movement underwater, did I worry too much?"
 Indomitable_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Commander, you look anxious, what's the matter? Um... the big mackerel is missing? Could it be... hee hee, it's okay, let's have a snack first, I seem to know where she is..."
 Indomitable_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Look--! I also made a golden flower for you, and you should keep it by your side at all times, so don't lose it!"
 Indomitable_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It is really interesting to give special training to the half-hearted armored aircraft carrier lady, although she still often complains about the injustice of fate, but there is already some vitality in her eyes...well...I really look forward to her future performance on the battlefield."
 Indomitable_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Oh, isn't this Miss Dafeng? I finally lowered my head to ask me for advice? Hehe...Come on, have a cup of tea, this kind of thing can't be anxious. But let me explain in advance, I will be an instructor But it's very strict~"
 Indomitable_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huh? The bell on your chest rang... Well-I have already sent you the alert message, is it okay if you don't deploy combat operations?... Strictly speaking, you can stay in a daze for up to two minutes. Timing begins!"
 Indomitable_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The commander is... Ah! Right here! I have detected the location!... Hee hee, Commander, what a coincidence, I met you again, let's take a walk together?"
 Sparviero_TouchDialog_1:0 "The weather seems to be pretty good today, can you help me take care of my back garden?"
  Sparviero_TouchDialog_2:0 "Great god, the first sage named after Augustus, Gaius Julius Octavian, please bless every sister who goes on the expedition to return safely."
 Sparviero_TouchDialog_3:0 "If the elite of the port area are dispatched just to fight for the inland sea of ​​country I, will it be too wasteful? Resources are not unlimited, so be frugal!"
 Sparviero_TouchDialog_4:0 "Miss Veneto is a veritable leader. She is the best in terms of temperament and strength. She should be the Augusta of the I navy... But every time I say this, she gets angry. ..."
 Sparviero_TouchDialog_5:0 "People always expect God to help them solve everything, but I can't respond to their expectations..."
 Sparviero_TouchDialog_6:0 "The ancient sages always liked to explore the universe among the dazzling stars, and then they became the shining stars in people's hearts."
 Sparviero_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "A spoonful of oil is enough for this dish...Although it may be too light, but it's better to be frugal in the very period. After all, it is good for the body..."
 Sparviero_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hehe, let's go to the hillside over there together. There are not many people there and the scenery is good... Hehe, although I didn't see it with my own eyes, I asked the little guy to fly to investigate. ~"
 Sparviero_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Huh-the ship is installed heavy, and I always feel like I'm going to fall over-ah? It's you, hehe, no matter when you are my strongest support..."
 Sparviero_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I heard that there was an emperor in the East who lost all his power from the day he was enthroned, until he was forced to abdicate and watched the country's demise... I don't know why, I feel that I can feel this feeling..."
 Sparviero_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I was helped by Zeppelin when I was very young. It is precisely because of this that I have a strong sister and who I am today."
 Sparviero_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I listen to people's complaints every day, so if I have troubles, I can only call you, hehe, okay?"
 Heermann_TouchDialog_1:0 "Commander~ Is it convenient to come over? I want to ask you to do an experiment~ Staring at this radar, 1, 2, 3! Now you are my subordinate~ Go and buy me some snacks!"
 Heermann_TouchDialog_2:0 "Be careful not to irritate me~ The way I get angry is very--very scary! Uh...what did you suddenly touch my back for? I'm not a cat, and it's useless to have a smooth hair!"
 Heermann_TouchDialog_3:0 "The heavy tour is just a lap bigger, what's to be afraid of~ I really don’t know who will win when we really fight~ Of course, the premise is that the weapons and equipment are in good condition. If you are not prepared, you can provoke others. That's silly~"
 Heermann_TouchDialog_4:0 "Torpedo is a very good deterrent weapon~ Those slow battleships are most afraid of this, as long as they throw all their brains out! Uh...Aiming? What a waste of time~"
 Heermann_TouchDialog_5:0 "Oh~! Johnston! You are all here~ Great, I am still worried that you will get lost. It seems that my worry is unnecessary. But now that the access time has passed, you are still fast Click back to the dormitory! Well, when the work is over, I will come and look for you~"
 Heermann_TouchDialog_6:0 ""I will not fall down! "--This is quite bluffing, haha. Think about it from another angle. When I look back on the battlefield, my comrades have fallen. This is even more painful than my own "end"."
 Heermann_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey! I found out, Tsukuma! Uh...Is it Mikuma? Sorry, I confessed to the wrong person! Just assume that I have never been here! Goodbye!"
 Heermann_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Almost embarrassed, huh... the back looks the same, but the front is completely different. How can there be such a thing! Hmm... the commander in front is the commander, this time you should not admit it... forget it , Take a break."
 Heermann_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Yo! Hoel~ What's wrong, I look disgusted when you see me. You said that with you, the official business will be solved soon, so I ran out to play~ Wow, you are Angry? Ah, that...I’m not good! I’m very sorry!"
 Heermann_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Samuel~ Are you coming for a simulation exercise? Let me see how long you have grown after so long! Haha, come up with your limits!"
 Heermann_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Let me use the searchlight to see...Oh, it really is the commander! Huh? Just now the equipment is malfunctioning, don't care about it~ Do you want to play together? Just leave the work behind!"
 Heermann_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It's time to go to bed at night, haha...so sleepy, my biological clock is urging me to go to sleephuh...ha...huh..."
 Kiev_TouchDialog_1:0 "My sisters and I think that speed is also an important weapon for destroyers. It should have a speed of 40 knots and above to be considered qualified..."
 Kiev_TouchDialog_2:0 "That elder sister named Veneto feels so powerful, and there is always an inexplicable sense of intimacy."
 Kiev_TouchDialog_3:0 "Comrade Commander, what do you think of my usual performance in combat and training?"
 Kiev_TouchDialog_4:0 "Ah...cough, do you want to see the night view? Sorry, my body is a bit bad lately, I can't go too far."
 Kiev_TouchDialog_5:0 "Don't relax at night, hurry up and train night combat skills. Grasping and judging the battlefield situation is a profound knowledge."
 Kiev_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sister Minsk seems to care about my combined gun..."
  Kiev_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I like polar bears very much because they are cute and healthy..."
 Kiev_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ah... the view of the Black Sea is so beautiful, especially when you enjoy it with you comrades. Cough, the wind is a bit strong, can you hug me?"
 Kiev_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "My dear, you were so gentle when you braided my hair..."
 Kiev_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The medal on the chest? This is a legend about the hero city. Come, let me tell you slowly..."
 Kiev_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Are you comrades still dealing with affairs, hard work! (kiss)"
 Kiev_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Wow, comrade! Look at my polar bear hug!"
 Tuscaloosa_TouchDialog_1:0 "Nevada, are you ready for a duel? Humph-I won't lose to you this time!"
 Tuscaloosa_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sister New Orleans, I have some questions about escorting you... You often escort the aircraft carrier ladies, you must have a lot of experience!"
 Tuscaloosa_TouchDialog_3:0 "Always vigilant is the basic requirement of being a good cowboy~!"
 Tuscaloosa_TouchDialog_4:0 "I don't know why Nevada likes gambling so much. It's more exciting to be a cowboy!"
 Tuscaloosa_TouchDialog_5:0 "The dream of traveling the world is really far away..."
 Tuscaloosa_TouchDialog_6:0 "Strange, was anyone here just now? The scum of snacks, and blue hair, could it be..."
 Tuscaloosa_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "When I checked the refrigerator recently, there were always some unexplainable snacks in it, Commander, could it be you who ate it?"
 Tuscaloosa_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "There is another task? Let me see where I am going?... Great! It's another place I haven't been to! In this way, I'm one step closer to my dream!"
 Tuscaloosa_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "My task is to escort, so no matter where you go, I will follow you~ hee hee~"
 Tuscaloosa_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The setting of the sun is the signal that the cowboys are off work... Tonight, would you like to go to the bar with me for a couple of drinks?"
 Tuscaloosa_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hush~Don't make such a loud noise, you won't have to eat it when Quincy hears it, come and taste it! The steak I made by myself, hum~This is something most people can't eat!"
 Tuscaloosa_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh-the wind here is much milder than the desert, but the sea is as cold and ruthless as the desert..."
 newLexington_TouchDialog_1:0 "Commander, a long rest period is not conducive to the growth of your own combat power-this, you must know it better than anyone. If there is nothing else...I will go to the captain to participate in the exercise."
 newLexington_TouchDialog_2:0 "The same name is a very common thing. I don't want you to impose the impression of another person on me. I am CV-16, a unique "blue ghost"."
 newLexington_TouchDialog_3:0 "The captain is not good at words, but she is accompanied by Teacher Bell McCann. And I...As long as you are here, I won't feel lonely."
 newLexington_TouchDialog_4:0 "Essex is both my sister and my captain. However, the one who communicated with me the most is Mr. Bell McCann. The way it is nagging, it really is... Seeing your face, you must have learned pass……"
 newLexington_TouchDialog_5:0 "No matter what setbacks the ghost suffers, it will stand up again, with the scars left by the previous failure, and challenge the so-called "destiny"."
 newLexington_TouchDialog_6:0 ""Lexington"-the glory and splendor carried by this name do not belong to me. I am the "blue ghost", and I will personally write my own legend. Until then...I may be able to Truly inherited this name..."
 newLexington_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "In addition to great feats that can be passed down to the world, there is also touching love. Those seemingly plain stories are often the most touching."
 newLexington_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I have no past, only the present pledged with you, and the future that goes hand in hand."
  newLexington_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It is called a "fake", so what? People who are ignorant and ignorant will always keep their eyes on the surface. This is the manifestation of "incompetence". And you have found the real "me" and chose I. You are my eternal destination."
 newLexington_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Mr. Bell McCann... are you teaching these cute little guys? I... can I listen? Even if it's only for a while... let me stay with these cute little guys for a while?"
 newLexington_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I'm sorry...for my casual joke, I bothered you to cook your own...Well, I'm very happy. You can also eat together, open your mouth, ah"
 newLexington_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I really want to sleep in your arms forever...Yes, everyone has a weak side. The same is true for me...because you are the only pillar in my life..."
 Norfolk_TouchDialog_1:0 "Wellwhat are you looking at? Is there anything worth paying attention to about me? Equipment? You have a vision! Let me introduce you to"
 Norfolk_TouchDialog_2:0 "Hunting prey is the most interesting thing. Watching the prey gradually lose the ability to resist due to lack of physical strength, and finally can only be slaughtered-what's wrong? Did I say something wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?"
 Norfolk_TouchDialog_3:0 "Kent, you have raised the ball more and more round...If this goes on, no one will recognize it as a tiger."
 Norfolk_TouchDialog_4:0 "If there is something nostalgic for in the Arctic Ocean, it must be the aurora. Especially the "crack" that accompanies the aurora, which makes people feel numb. Hum...it's so beautiful! "
 Norfolk_TouchDialog_5:0 "Some guys still don't understand, even if they build themselves into a fortress on the sea, what can they do? Just one person can't change the situation of the battle."
 Norfolk_TouchDialog_6:0 "If you don't want to be hit by the enemy, you have to preemptively break its radar. Missing? I never fail, so don't underestimate people."
 Norfolk_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "This kid, are you fishing? I think no fish will come here. After all, this is a swimming pool, right?"
 Norfolk_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Is it fun to poke someone in the face? Then I will poke you in the face too-don't resist, it's not a very ordinary thing."
 Norfolk_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Meow-ball ball ~ where did you go ball ball? Oops, you have to find it before Kent returns. Ball ball, here is your favorite ball of yarn~ come out soon~"
 Norfolk_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "What book are you reading? Hmm...I don't understand any of these squares. Or, would you read it to me?"
 Norfolk_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "For me, fixing the target is really not that difficult. You can hit the bullseye even with your eyes closed. Well, it's a very common thing, and you can do it with more practice."
 Norfolk_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Uh, uhhhh, forgot to say something. Then...good night~ this must be true."
 Sterett_TouchDialog_1:0 "Why do you want to practice shelling? The destroyer should give full play to its advantage and launch more torpedoes, just like this...Ha! Didn't you hit it? Hahaha...accident, accident..."
 Sterett_TouchDialog_2:0 "High mobility with multiple torpedo tubes is synonymous with power."
 Sterett_TouchDialog_3:0 "Fight bravely, sisters, only warriors can survive the battle."
 Sterett_TouchDialog_4:0 "We must hit next time! Such a shameful scene, I don't want to appear a second time, torpedo launch!"
 Sterett_TouchDialog_5:0 "Don't have an inexplicable plane rushing over... It's a lifelong nightmare to deal with that kind of desperate attack..."
 Sterett_TouchDialog_6:0 "Lafite, if you are willing to listen to me, install more torpedo tubes, I think you can do more than just attack the battleship with the main gun..."
 Sterett_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "It's going to train, so hurry up... I have also made a training plan for you, but don't want to slack off."
 Sterett_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The commander is here?...Ahem, everyone can take a break and continue later...Why are you here at this time and don't notify me in advance..."
  Sterett_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Why the ocean belongs to us depends on the face of others to decide the itinerary, Commander, you come over to me, go, go out to sea today, if any enemies dare to come, I will knock them back!"
 Sterett_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The word lucky does not apply to me. If I am lucky enough, those torpedoes should hit them!"
 Sterett_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "You seem to be bothered by these files, do you want me to help you?... Know how good I am, how can I reward me?"
 Sterett_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Training is over...The light is still on in the commander's office...This guy really doesn't know how tired, forget it, anyway, it's boring, go make a pot of coffee..."
 Myoukou_TouchDialog_1:0 "If you want to climb the peak, you must be fully prepared. But first, you must have a strong body. The body is the capital of action~"
 Myoukou_TouchDialog_2:0 "How long do you have to stay in the bathhouse before you come out? Don't let me wait for you every time. Alas, how should I say how are you..."
 Myoukou_TouchDialog_3:0 "Are you owed repairs again? You even put up the flagship shelf in front of your sister. You have to distinguish the occasion. It's not in battle now, you know?"
 Myoukou_TouchDialog_4:0 "Doctor? I didn't expect to meet you here... No, I am not damaged, thank you for your concern. I just want to hear these mechanical sounds."
 Myoukou_TouchDialog_5:0 "Is it really something to be pleased to be an object of attention? Being forced on others' expectations is like being put on an invisible shackle. Alas, it's hard to live."
 Myoukou_TouchDialog_6:0 "Once it's night, my vigilance will be doubled. Um... it's probably a sequelae from the previous security team, but it's not a bad thing."
 Myoukou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I used to be a real idiot. I moved on a fixed route and lived a life like a machine. I really want to delete that memory in my mind forever..."
 Myoukou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "When sailing at sea, there are very few ways to relieve fatigue. Huh? Fishing? This is against military discipline. No one will do it with integrity."
 Myoukou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "These minerals are "miracles" born through the accumulation of time, bathed in starlight, shining on this stage called "the world"."
 Myoukou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The life of the garrison is undoubtedly boring. This is a sacrifice for everyone to sleep peacefully."
 Myoukou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Use rarity to distinguish your favorite characters. Don't you think this is a bit of a bit of a bit? Love should be equal instead of being divided by these dazzling colors."
 Myoukou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I don't like the taste of waiting... It's better to say that I have had enough. I have to wait for everything, this is also, that is also-has all the bad luck gathered on me?"
 Augusta_TouchDialog_1:0 "It's a bit noisy outside, it seems that there is a dispute, but I suggest you don't interfere with their affairs casually, this is a more wise decision."
 Augusta_TouchDialog_2:0 "My sister Northampton is a very powerful warship! If anyone dares to bully me, it will not end well!"
 Augusta_TouchDialog_3:0 "Rather than being a handsome general, I still want to be by your side and be a little secretary. Then...you and me have different feelings, and I will become your future His wife...hehe, blushing~!"
 Augusta_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hundreds of years ago, a great man proposed isolationism, allowing the newly born U country to survive and develop in the cracks of various big countries. Now, for the same reason, we have to abandon this continuation of the data. A hundred years of spirit, this makes me unacceptable..."
 Augusta_TouchDialog_5:0 "The blonde girl wearing glasses in Country I, seeing how my eyes are always full of resentment..."
 Augusta_TouchDialog_6:0 "When you rest, get up and walk more, move your shoulders and waist, or it will be bad for your body~"
  Augusta_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I've reviewed these documents, can you sign it? It's anxious...hee hee, don't you want to see the specific content? I will leave it to you for dinner tonight, and I will invite my sister to come Eat, come on~!"
 Augusta_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The combat meeting is about to begin. Don't run around... When this is over, you have to rush... Huh? You are a little tired. Would you like a cup of black coffee?"
 Augusta_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hehe--according to the business trip plan, a romantic honeymoon can be arranged here. If the commander knows, he will be very happy!"
 Augusta_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Country F is a big liar! Huh-anything without shelling ability is a lie!... Commander, can you lighten the wound when you wipe it? It hurts..."
 Augusta_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "If I can, I really don't want to get involved in any nasty disputes... But, I can't let you go..."
 Augusta_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I saw it that day. I saw them fighting bravely, but I... I would like to apologize to them if I have the opportunity. Commander, will they forgive me?"
 Defender_TouchDialog_1:0 "What is the loot that Miss Ella collects every once in a while?"
 Defender_TouchDialog_2:0 "Biao, Javelin-senior! Early, early! Hey, where are you going, can you take me with me?... Being with seniors will make you feel more at ease!"
 Defender_TouchDialog_3:0 "When fighting, I just need to manipulate this to hide, and then I will attract firepower by myself... so that I can form a pincer on the enemy! How about it, am I very smart?"
 Defender_TouchDialog_4:0 "My equipment is the strongest suit that my predecessors have summed up in actual combat. The Royal Navy will never lag behind others!"
 Defender_TouchDialog_5:0 "Eh? The radar spotted the Welsh senior who was alone. Why is she there alone...so lonely...well...don't be nervous...don't be nervous...go chat with her Bar."
 Defender_TouchDialog_6:0 "Senior Javelin, you see, I can already use this equipment proficiently, is it very powerful?"
 Defender_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Because of the hope of the predecessors, I will never allow myself to have any slack, Commander, a new day, let's cheer together!"
 Defender_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Kiev! What do you mean?! What is the basic ability of a destroyer is a speed of 40 knots?! Do you want a showdown, let me tell you what cruelty is!"
 Defender_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Before coming to the port area, I visited my friends in the village and got the best things...Of course, this is not something to grab, they will thank me for it!"
 Defender_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Hehe, this was originally a little hat given to me by the glorious senior. With the help of the firefly senior, how about it? Is it cute?"
 Defender_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "After signing an oath with you, I often think about a question... Why are diamond rings sold in shops in Minato?"
 Defender_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The business travelers who passed by said that a robber appeared recently. Everywhere he went, he would smash the jars and open every box... Huh? This route is the same as the route I took when I came to the port area. , How come I haven't seen that bad guy?"
 Incomparable_TouchDialog_1:0 "The predecessors are very good, and I and I will not lag behind, please rest assured..."
 Incomparable_TouchDialog_2:0 "In addition to speed, we must also have an advantage in the caliber of the main gun... Hey, it's really troublesome..."
 Incomparable_TouchDialog_3:0 "Just now I was discussing some artillery essentials with reputation and war exhaustion. It took a lot of time, but I am really happy to be able to help the seniors!"
  Incomparable_TouchDialog_4:0 "Even with the development of the times and the changing circumstances, I must never change my heart easily. In this regard, the prestigious predecessors have taught me a lot..."
 Incomparable_TouchDialog_5:0 "Ah... I just wanted to be a little bit lazy. I didn't expect to be discovered by you. Don't tell the seniors... The prestige will be fatal if they start a fire."
 Incomparable_TouchDialog_6:0 "In terms of tactics, we can make the high-speed battleship sweep the enemy's avant-garde first, and then use the battle line of the battleship to defeat the enemy...Ah, can you please tell everyone what I think, not just what I said. good……"
 Incomparable_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I need to take care of my hair a little bit, ah...you don't care? After all, I am your partner now, and everyone in the port is the target of attention. I can't have the slightest slack!"
 Incomparable_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Leading everyone like a lion, I, I can't do it... If it's just a private communication, it's okay to lead you to an unparalleled aura... I'm still a little scared..."
 Incomparable_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Does I feel like a different person in the fight? ... I don't know what kind of me you love more?"
 Incomparable_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Is that woman in country G crazy... She has to fight with people at every turn... But hehe, she will be very happy after winning~"
 Incomparable_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Um-this aroma... Is the black tea made by the prestige?... Um-it is so happy to be able to drink the red tea of ​​the prestige after a busy day! I am not lazy today!"
 Incomparable_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Not everyone in E country can make black tea... I didn't study it seriously when the seniors taught me, but it is not important, right, right?"
 Shinyou_TouchDialog_1:0 "Admiral, you have been staring here. Is there any task for me? Isn't it? That's dry eyes. I have eye drops. Please feel welcome."
 Shinyou_TouchDialog_2:0 "I didn't expect you to be here. It's really... Tsk, your poisonous tongue has not changed at all. Wouldn't it be better to be more honest? Alas, whatever you want."
 Shinyou_TouchDialog_3:0 "I heard the nostalgic name. Do those former friends remember me? Hey, they looked over here?! What should I do now..."
 Shinyou_TouchDialog_4:0 "The electric propulsion system I am equipped with is unique among my colleagues. This is the most proud treasure given to me by the motherland."
 Shinyou_TouchDialog_5:0 "That guy...showing Tianshan and Comet in front of me again, but just chanting her...find time to apologize to her."
 Shinyou_TouchDialog_6:0 "Admiral, I made my own proposal to help you change the mattress, I hope you don’t mind. How? Is it particularly comfortable? After all, my country is second to none in terms of technology~"
 Shinyou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Fishing has no knack, you just need to wait patiently for the prey to be hooked, deal with it and consume its physical strength, and then-it's hard just like this? You lack exercise, right."
 Shinyou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Although that is the name of the past, I don’t feel like hearing someone use it to address others every day. Can you understand this complicated mood?"
 Shinyou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 ""Wolf Pack Tactics"-the wisdom of the people of the motherland is amazing! Cut off the enemy's supplies and drive them into desperation! Uh... suddenly a little bit timid, so strange..."
 Shinyou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "As far as the performance of the boiler is concerned, no one can compare to my original boiler. In every sense, I "have the treasure"."
 Shinyou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "She is as enthusiastic as she always did. She lent me the comet without any hesitation. Okay, let me study its structure. As long as it is modified properly, I can also let these new carrier aircraft take off."
 Shinyou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Hey, thanks for your care. This thing... is called "oathed", right? It's warm and refreshing. If I have time, I will also make some specialties of my home country for you, so stay tuned Bar."
 DeGrasse_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hey-after sleeping for so long, even the ship's outfit is different from the previous design... I hope I can adapt as soon as possible and contribute to the defense of the port area."
 DeGrasse_TouchDialog_2:0 "General Richelieu is really a role model for our generation, and it is precisely because of believing in her that I will stick to it so far. Next, it's up to me."
 DeGrasse_TouchDialog_3:0 "Weakness and compromise are also a kind of sin. Even the humble person can find a means to resist if he wants to."
  DeGrasse_TouchDialog_4:0 "No matter how long the night is, the dawn will eventually come..."
 DeGrasse_TouchDialog_5:0 "Unexpectedly, the guys engaged in scientific research really designed this ship outfit. It looks perfect in every way, but I don't know if there will be a chance to install a missile launcher in the future..."
 DeGrasse_TouchDialog_6:0 "After work, don't forget to maintain the habit of exercising. It is good for your body~ Hehe, you should consult Dunkirk or Richelieu in this regard."
 DeGrasse_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Um-so sleepy, I really want to sleep for a while...just five minutes, hehe, call me later..."
 DeGrasse_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The combination of skill and romance, and coexistence of chic and gentleness, this is the charm that belongs to the people of F country."
 DeGrasse_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Alright~ You just have to rest here, let me handle these tasks for you... I don't want to delay your appointment at night because of these things..."
 DeGrasse_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Ahhhhh, is it just a nightmare? The cold port, I am the only one left, and I can only see the cold war machine...everything feels so real."
 DeGrasse_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Why are you still working at night? Shouldn't you be with me at this time?"
 DeGrasse_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I'm too strict with Walkerland. I scolded her when she was too weak during the day. As a result, she was depressed till now... Alas, General, this is my snack, please send it to Walkerland. Well, maybe she will be happier... By the way, don't say I gave it."
 Neustrashimy_TouchDialog_1:0 "This flag is not a weapon! No one would wave a flag to fight... Wait, it seems okay... No, no! The flag is not for hitting people!"
 Neustrashimy_TouchDialog_2:0 "Trust! I finally saw you again~ I can't find anyone there to chat with...It's so lonely. It's great to meet you again!"
 Neutral
 Neustrashimy_TouchDialog_4:0 "What's so scary about the dark night? Those monsters are the dregs of nihilism! How can there be these things in reality. Comrades, there is a big problem in your ideological construction. Do you need me to help you fix it?"
 Neustrashimy_TouchDialog_5:0 "Comrade, what are you looking for? The ship number? That keeps changing, there is no fixed number, so I didn’t paint it this time. If the comrade is so interested, the comrade will come and pick me up a new ship. Number~"
 Neustrashimy_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sister S’s drinking volume is a little too good... Is this the power of the battleship? Uh... I still can’t drink, I can’t accompany the eldest sister-can fruit and juice?"
 Neustrashimy_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Wow! Fruit hard candy! A few pieces of fruit candy should be okay? Comrade~ I applied for the fruit candy here! Oh! Thanks for permission from Comrade! I'm going to start"
 Neustrashimy_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Comrade! Freshly baked corn juice! This is squeezed from natural and pollution-free corn. It is very healthy! Come and have a drink together! It is very good for your body!"
 Neustrashimy_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "When I was still over there, Trust and I were good friends who talked everything. Then she left, and it took me a long time to cheer up. But now it’s alright, I can see her every day~ And comrades are with me, I am not alone at all~"
 Neustrashimy_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "They said I can't drink anymore, Sister S... Well, do you know where there is firewood? I want to bake sweet potatoes-wow! Why did you pour the wine on it? It burned..."
 Neustrashimy_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "This flying little thing is called-uh, I don't know how to translate it, what do you want to call it? Oh... it seems to be a good name, and it looks very happy too~"
 Neustrashimy_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Ah! It's already so late! Comrade, go and rest! Otherwise the hairline will rise! Eventually you will become bald-hey, good night~ dear comrade~"
 Volta_TouchDialog_1:0 "Mr. Joan of Arc! I have fully mastered the fighting skills, please rest assured, even you, I have the confidence to fight from the front!"
 Volta_TouchDialog_2:0 "I really want to compete with the destroyers of country S..."
 Volta_TouchDialog_3:0 "Fantasy, don't run so fast, at least take a look at the road before walking... Uh... I fell down again..."
 Volta_TouchDialog_4:0 "Volkland, you and I are both super destroyers, so why don't you show yourself a little confidence? Come on, work out with me!"
 Volta_TouchDialog_5:0 "I want to be like Richelieu too! Fight for the liberation of my homeland! What a domineering and mighty!"
  Volta_TouchDialog_6:0 "That guy seems to have completely forgotten the agreement between us. It seems that she is going to pay a price for her arrogance."
 Volta_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "You seem to be late~! This is not a good habit. Please remember that only those who are rigorous can feel more at ease."
 Volta_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ah! The main gun is malfunctioning again. Is it the sand or something... Can the general help me... Huh, I hope I can improve it so that there are not so many malfunctions, which are very in the way..."
 Volta_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "General, general, I will deliberately lose to Volkland during the exercise for a while, so please don't dismantle it~!"
 Volta_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Pompeii, I finally waited for you, now you can't escape. Come on, face me up like a hero, and enjoy the pain of being defeated by me..."
 Volta_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huh-so tired, why are they so energetic, they all have the same training...no, no, I'm going to sleep first..."
 Volta_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "If you can, accompany me to buy a mini skirt during the break? Hehe, I want to wear the one you choose for me~!"
 Take_TouchDialog_1:0 "Little pawns also have pawn fighting styles, but don't underestimate them because of their ranks. Great generals also start with pawns and climb to the top step by step!"
 Take_TouchDialog_2:0 "My lord! There are so many delicious things here! Don't worry, our family motto is not to waste, I will eat all of these things! I'll start~"
 Take_TouchDialog_3:0 "Well, where should I start digging? Huh? I'm not looking for treasure, I'm planning to dig trenches. Speaking of making the city easy to defend and difficult to attack, that's trenches! Hey? Isn't that the case? !"
 Take_TouchDialog_4:0 "Speaking of "win the strong with the weak", I have a decent record! Hey, that's why I said! My lord~ I am not a trash fish!"
 Take_TouchDialog_5:0 "Those gloating guys are just a few classes higher than ours, so they dare to tell people that we are "wood forests" everywhere! I really want to make a hole in the faces of those guys!"
 Take_TouchDialog_6:0 "My lord! I'm bringing you a supper! Look, it's eggplant! Humph, because our ancestors once said, "Eggplant is the most suitable food for rulers. "That's it, hurry up and taste it~"
 Take_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The object of admiration? Of course it is the adult who is known as the "first soldier"! Hmm... Although I am a bit sorry for the ancestors, I also want to be invincible on the battlefield like that adult land!"
 Take_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Tempura is really delicious! Hmm, it's just that the purse is becoming empty with the naked eye...what, what should I do, my lord?!"
 Take_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "My lord~ I saw a batch of new equipment came in from the factory, can I try it out? It only takes a while! I also want to experience the power of battleship main guns, okay~"
 Take_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Goo...the whole body is falling apart, completely unable to move...just, just wearing it and not firing the cannon...the battleships...are all monsters!!!"
 Take_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Perhaps I am inferior to the predecessors in other aspects, but in terms of the safety of the power system, the predecessors are definitely inferior to me~"
 Take_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "My lord, come and play Go! There is plenty of time, and it is still very early before sunrise~ As the master of a party, Go is also one of the necessary skills!"
 Pompeo_TouchDialog_1:0 "Enjoy your life every day, because tomorrow is uncertain."
 Pompeo_TouchDialog_2:0 "It is very dangerous for so many strange vehicles to run around in the port area. Archon, do you need to build a sidewalk to ensure everyone's safety?"
 Pompeo_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey, how come a little girl from country F always stares at me with fierce eyes, did I do something wrong?"
 Pompeo_TouchDialog_4:0 "Always keep the fourth line of defense for yourself. This is what my former opponent taught me, and it is also the combat creed I believe in now."
 Pompeo_TouchDialog_5:0 "There is a question, I want to confirm with you first, there should be no volcanoes near the port area, right?"
 Pompeo_TouchDialog_6:0 "Hey, little guy, you have been staring at me viciously since I came to the port area. Now you want to follow me again and say, what are you trying to do?"
 Pompeo_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The kid staring at me... is it Volta? Hehe... Don't worry, Lord Archon, I won't hurt her, but... I think of it as if I had an interesting agreement with her. "
 Pompeo_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Please don’t worry about the military training. You just need to... let everyone like you like you win over me, hehe... You must be good at this aspect~~ But no one likes you more Yes, as evidenced by Mount Vesuvius."
 Pompeo_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The way Sister Rome fired is so handsome! I also want to be like her... Anyway, I have inherited the name of the Roman Big Three, and I will definitely be able to do it well. If you don't believe it... Cough cough... Hello, Lord Archon, I am Rome The great Pompeii of the second-class battleship II... (sounds of exasperation) Seriously, no, no laughter!"
 Pompeo_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Volta, I won this time. Although there is an Italian proverb called "Caesar cry, Pompei laughs", I am not dissatisfied with having a good opponent like you. Let's cry , And then... continue to challenge me~ This is a unique reward for you. Hehe~"
 Pompeo_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Since I met you, I know how powerful the human heart is, and it can even change an already established situation. Sure enough, I had lost the war from the beginning..."
  Pompeo_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Don’t underestimate yourself. The role of any one person in history is beyond your estimation. Just like the alliance of the Three Giants in ancient Rome, it did not die to me or Caesar, but Died to the forgotten death of Krasu."
 Aquila_TouchDialog_1:0 "Where did the little Harrier go? Let me guess...Is it going to the back garden, or just sleeping in?"
 Aquila_TouchDialog_2:0 "The characters of the elders in the Royal Navy are really more interesting than the other. It's a pity that I came late, otherwise the protagonist in those deeds will become me."
 Aquila_TouchDialog_3:0 "Do the little guys want to attack me? Hehe, the anti-aircraft firepower is on! It seems that you don't know what kind of opponent you are facing~"
 Aquila_TouchDialog_4:0 "Strange, sometimes I just explain some facts, they get angry, they are really a bunch of cute guys, hehe~"
 Aquila_TouchDialog_5:0 "Harrier, frugality is a good thing. But don't overdo it. It's good to let everyone relax occasionally. Remember, you are Augusta who meets everyone's wishes, not a fierce little girl. Hehe. Hey, I dare not go on, or I will be beaten~"
 Aquila_TouchDialog_6:0 "The sir hasn't rested yet? Hee hee, you ask me? I am tutoring everyone's experience and fighting summary. After all, I came late, and I have to find a way to catch up. Otherwise, I will be laughed at."
 Aquila_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I didn't get up late, am I? Please look forward to the orthodox Roman cuisine I prepared specially for you today."
 Aquila_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Antonio is so cute, he can laugh so happily with a candy. Hehe, I really want to be like her."
 Aquila_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Gui'an, Miss Pompeii, you are in good spirits today. Would you like to take a walk with me?...Um? The sir also wants to be together? It depends on Miss Pompeii's agreement or disagreement."
 Aquila_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Sir...Ah, Rome is here too. It's a coincidence. It just happens that this matter is also related to you. I am going to change my name back to Rome. Do you think...hehe, it seems someone is going to get angry, it looks good Cute~ "
 Aquila_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Oh, it turns out that Royal Ark has such an experience... Ah, sir, why are you here, my notebook... hee hee, it's just to remember the characteristics of everyone, so you can use it at any time~! You see Look, is it comprehensive?"
 Aquila_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Strange, why there is no written record about Sukhbaatar, and there is no way to complain about her... Sir, do you know what's going on?"
 Impero_TouchDialog_1:0 "Well~even if you keep staring at it, the flight deck will not become the main gun. Sisters are battleships and I am an aircraft carrier. Is there any problem with this? There is no problem at all, right~"
 Impero_TouchDialog_2:0 "Huh...How long do I have to stay in this position if I want to sleep? I'm losing strength in my hands, and I almost can't open my eyes... Huh... Huh"
 Impero_TouchDialog_3:0 "Sister Rome is very good, in terms of character and figure, she is perfect. You said Sister Veneto? Well... Except for being a little shorter, she has no shortcomings."
 Impero_TouchDialog_4:0 "This is my new book. It tells the story of the re-emergence of a lost empire. From nothing to power over the world, what an inspirational and passionate story~"
 Impero_TouchDialog_5:0 "Eh, I received a briefing from TianyingYeah, that's what it means here. "Thank you, I will ask you to eat cake next time I come to play~"Send. Okay, continue Read it."
 Impero_TouchDialog_6:0 "The main gun looks very heavy, I don't want to equip that kind of thing at all. I am very satisfied with the situation now, after all, there are a lot of books in the hangar, just like a mobile library~"
 Impero_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Oh... I have delivered all the books bought at a discount a while ago, hehe, no wonder this express package is so big... I just woke up and I don’t have enough energy yet-can you help me move into the room? Thanks~ I will reward you."
 Impero_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Sister Rome...why did you drag me to the exercise site? I am an aircraft carrier. No matter how many times I watch your exercises, I can't use the main gun. I want to sleep, I'm serious."
 Impero_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Oh...you are so idle. You keep staring at me here, and you still touch my head from time to time. Is this a good performance? Then I will pull your ears. This is what I use to show Good way."
 Impero_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Sister Veneto, I will go to bed on time. You don't need to keep an eye on me. Instead of caring about me, it's better to care about you first-sorry, the older sister is over the age of development, and I said the wrong thing. "
 Impero_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Turn left, turn right, then turn left three times-ah, it's open. The eldest sister is also true, and even hides the book I am reading in this place. Reading is clearly a sensation It's a pleasant thing, why doesn't she understand it?"
 Impero_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Um...It's you, that scared me. Do you still have work to do? Me? "Just come here to read a book, by the way, will I meet you~"-if the reality is A love novel, I will probably answer you like this~"
 Bolzano_TouchDialog_1:0 "Miss Prestige, thank you for accompany me to practice combat skills...I will work hard to truly surpass you one day."
 Bolzano_TouchDialog_2:0 "Are you going to expedition with Pompeii today? Looks like a good junior. It seems that we should get along well."
 Bolzano_TouchDialog_3:0 "Aim, open--...hey, Rome is calling me? Ah... Rome run!"
  Bolzano_TouchDialog_4:0 "How do you feel that our I navy always has some bad reviews... Obviously everyone is very powerful..."
 Bolzano_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sir, are you free? I don't understand the art of war that Cleveland gave me. Can you explain it to me?"
 Bolzano_TouchDialog_6:0 "It would be great if it were daytime 24 hours a day...so that I could train hard anytime!"
 Bolzano_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ah-did you bother you? I'm going out to train. You can sleep for a while. I'll call you when I'm back."
 Bolzano_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Do you want to be busy with work today or do you want to be lazy and take a break?...It doesn't matter, don't think about me, I will just follow your arrangements."
 Bolzano_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Is it better to do this when fighting?... It really is a newcomer not to be underestimated, Pompeii, let me tell me more about the combat skills you have mastered in the future, thank you~!"
 Bolzano_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Huhit's already so late...ah, sir, have you been watching my training?"
 Bolzano_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I usually look dishonest, but when fighting, he burst out with amazing power... Ugolini, this guy, really can't see it..."
 Bolzano_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Would you like to tell me something? Is it about the future or the present? Hehe, the past is not important. The memories before meeting me are not counted."
 Dragon_TouchDialog_1:0 "Belfast is such a nice person, he always invites me to have afternoon tea. It is more difficult to understand that she likes to call my sister..."
 Dragon_TouchDialog_2:0 "The horns on my head? Please don't care about such small things. Please also don't touch the horns. My helmet is a bit crooked, it's true."
 Dragon_TouchDialog_3:0 "For that belief, there can be no slack in training..."
 Dragon_TouchDialog_4:0 "Oh, do I look fierce? Today, a destroyer said I was terrible..."
 Dragon_TouchDialog_5:0 "Uh... Did you scare you? I'm not sharpening the knife, just maintaining the armor."
 Dragon_TouchDialog_6:0 "We have had a brilliant record and past, Commander, would you like to hear it."
 Dragon_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Wow! It's super fierce."
 Dragon_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Do I have a big appetite? This is just half full..."
 Dragon_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Really, I promised to go shopping together, so I'm tired after mentioning this thing? Well, let me give you a buff. (kiss)"
 Dragon_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The feeling we had when we played the piano together is beautiful beyond words. (blushing)"
 Dragon_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "This is a special dress I sew for you by myself. There is still armor. Do you want to try to fit it. This is for us to wear when we attend the military parade together."
 Dragon_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "You are so gentle when you touch the corner, so comfortable (slobbering), it feels... so sleepy..."
 KangWon_TouchDialog_1:0 "It's wrong to judge people by their appearance, have you heard?...Um...When talking to me, please sit down or squat down...No, no, I just stand!"
 KangWon_TouchDialog_2:0 "Ulsan is a very reliable junior. For example, it would be better if she didn't pick me up suddenly... Wait, what do you mean by this look."
 KangWon_TouchDialog_3:0 "This suit was prepared by Zhong Wu after I entered the port area. How about it? Does it fit me well?...Although she is only a little earlier than me, she is already familiar with Kr's culture. "
 KangWon_TouchDialog_4:0 "This smell is... I can smell the smell of beef! Is it Ulsan's room?... Although it feels dangerous to step into Ulsan's room alone, but beef... Forget it, it's a horrible thing if you don't enter the tiger's den ."
 KangWon_TouchDialog_5:0 "Admiral, if you feel upset, I suggest you go out and take a look at the beautiful scenery... Staying indoors for a long time is more likely to make people depressed, and the charm of nature will cure all of this."
 KangWon_TouchDialog_6:0 "My purpose in joining the port is to protect everything that nature brings us."
 KangWon_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ulsan! Concentrate on dealing with surface ships, and leave it to me and Zhongmu underwater... Hey, if you want to escape my eyes, don't even think about it!"
 KangWon_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Okay--tired--ah--! Admiral, I'm so tired that I can't move, unless...unless you buy me sweets to eat, otherwise I will just sit here and not move!"
 KangWon_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Miss Missouri, I heard that you like to organize your story files... Can you teach me how to do it? I also want to learn this knowledge."
 KangWon_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Admiral, I’m ready to go for a walk, come, hold me... Ah! Let me go! Shame, shame!... Riding on your neck like this will hold you down. ..."
  KangWon_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Why the admiral hasn’t come back yet? Really... Let me punish you, tomato sauce... Knife... Cannonball... Hey, you’re done, and then I’ll be scared by my “death” when you come back. Jump!"
 KangWon_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Really, really scared me to death... Zhongwu, let me tell you that the admiral suddenly carried me on his shoulders today and let me ride... that height... I, I almost feared height!"
 Ulsan_TouchDialog_1:0 "I am a guided missile destroyer with modern advanced equipment and design, no matter what kind of mission...Of course, except for anti-submarine."
 Ulsan_TouchDialog_2:0 "Is the patrol going to start?...Wait for me, let me check the equipment... Actually, I just checked when I got up in the morning, but it's better to be safe."
 Ulsan_TouchDialog_3:0 "I was born out of people's voices, and high expectations from everyone... Now, I need a real battle to prove myself."
 Ulsan_TouchDialog_4:0 "The strongest warrior is not always good at everything, but the best in his field."
 Ulsan_TouchDialog_5:0 "My hometown is half a city and half a sea. This port area... is very similar to my hometown."
 Ulsan_TouchDialog_6:0 "Senior Chungmu, I'm here to take over~ Hey, don't worry, leave it to me, I won't let you down."
 Ulsan_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Is my hat very handsome? It was given to me by Senior Zhongmu when I was in the military. Hehe, I like it very much!"
 Ulsan_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Admiral, are you busy now?... I saw a lot of pigeons on the square on the way I just came. Bring something with me to feed them... Hee hee, go!"
 Ulsan_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Would you like to watch the sunrise together? The sunrise on the top of the mountain is fascinating...but you need someone to accompany you to have an artistic conception. Give me your hand and get up! (pull)"
 Ulsan_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Admiral, Admiral! You came just right... Look, I just made hot pot... How does it taste? Let me see what I can add next... Would you like luncheon meat?"
 Ulsan_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Admiral, can we plant some ginkgo trees in the yard?...and plant some pear trees...Look, there is a clearing there, OK to plant it there?"
 Ulsan_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Senior Gangwon is so cute... I really want to take her back to the dormitory... Ahem, did you hear anything?"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_1:0 "Everyone looked at me with expectant eyes... Doesn't that make you more nervous... Calm, calm, at least not shaking when talking."
 Spring
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_3:0 "I have learned what the Fletcher sisters taught me. Regardless of drills or battles, don't worry, I'll be fine!"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_4:0 "Here should be stitched like this... if the pattern is like this, do this first, and then... Ah! It hurts, it's stuck again... Let's take a break and continue!"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_5:0 "Do you like potted plants?...I, I made one on your table, you don't hate it, do you?"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_6:0 "Always staying up late will make you physically and mentally tired. If you want someone to accompany you...you can find me...well, anytime."
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "When I first arrived in the port area, I was always afraid of this and that. Now it’s silly to look at me in the past. Everyone is very good! Especially the admiral you!"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "What do you have for breakfast today?...Admiral, Admiral~What do you want for breakfast? As long as you don't make excessive demands!"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Admiral, it is better to be more cautious in doing things, but don't be too scared of everything like me..."
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Admiral! Look, this is the clothes I made for Jiangyuan by myself. Is it cute? ... Hee hee, what's the matter? You want it too? Then tell me, what kind of clothes do you want? , Let me play?"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Admiral, Admiral? Why do you look frowning...Okay, okay, okay, okay, can you take a break?... Come on, lean in my arms, don’t think so much~ The admiral is so cute and cute~ !"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Ulsan, seeing your face flushed, is there something interesting?...Come on, let me tell my sister, don't be so shy, don't be so restrained between our sisters~!"
 Wisconsin_TouchDialog_1:0 "It seems that it has been a long time since the last time I retired and joined the war this time. Many equipment has been updated... It takes time to get familiar with it, and my own knowledge should also be updated."
  Wisconsin_TouchDialog_2:0 "This task is a bit heavy... Hey hey, Commander, can you give me a double salary, quietly give me, I won't tell you~ I will thank you~ Hee hee, How about it?"
 Wisconsin_TouchDialog_3:0 "In fact, I still miss the feeling of fighting on the battlefield. That's why I came back here. I didn't expect it to be more interesting than I thought, thank you~"
 Wisconsin_TouchDialog_4:0 "The mistakes made at the beginning will never be repeated...Because that kind of thing has been laughed at for so long, what smiles like...Ah-I hope it will not affect my image in front of everyone..."
 Wisconsin_TouchDialog_5:0 "Commander, is there anything else I can help? But correspondingly, after finishing work tonight... how about a drink with me?"
 Wisconsin_TouchDialog_6:0 "Missouri...tsk, it seems that you are also a big star here, but should you be a bit crisis-conscious? After all, I'm here...huh? Is that white-haired woman coming to you? Hey, I didn’t expect you to like this, so I won’t bother you~"
 Wisconsin_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Want me to make breakfast for you by myself? It's so beautiful~ This lady has never learned this kind of thing, shouldn't you make it for me? Or...you come and teach me?"
 Wisconsin_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Okay, the work plan is completed, please be sure to implement it on time. Especially here...and here, there must be no mistake in the time with me."
 Wisconsin_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hey, Commander, tell me about other interesting sisters in the port area besides the American sisters, especially the one who has been asking Missouri for trouble called Hindenburg... It's so interesting! I am special to her Interested~!"
 Wisconsin_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Missouri will also be entangled. It's really embarrassing. It seems that this place is more interesting than I thought~ Hey? What is the figure in front of? , Or... do you want to be beaten?"
 Wisconsin_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, tell me what happened before I came here... I don’t want to do anything, just pure curiosity. After all, I want to know all about you~"
 Wisconsin_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It is very hard to return to the army several times. Each time it takes a lot of time to adapt, but this time with you, I can still be happier. Of course, there are many interesting sisters."
 Sheffield_TouchDialog_1:0 "A pleasant afternoon will naturally be accompanied by someone from Britainwell, are you looking at me? If you want to join our tea party, just say it directly~ You are very welcome, Commander Your Mightiness."
 Sheffield_TouchDialog_2:0 "Guess how my other name, "Sparkling Sheffield" came from? Ah, is "Sparkling and Beautiful"? You are really good at flattering people~Although it is not much different from the correct answer~ "
 Sheffield_TouchDialog_3:0 "The process of chasing the "kitten" is very interesting. Whenever it comes to aftertaste, it is like tasting a good glass of Fortnum&Mason. Um~ it makes people forget to return~"
 Sheffield_TouchDialog_4:0 "Royal Ark, what are you looking for so late? Ah, the swordfish is gone? Well... I have other things to do, sorry."
 Sheffield_TouchDialog_5:0 "He looks like a wicked person, but after being beaten, he just hugs his head, and turns others into a bad luck. Isn't this considered "a person not to look like"? Hehe~"
 Sheffield_TouchDialog_6:0 "I advise you not to stand under the street lamp, because if I also pass, your eyes will be irreversibly traumatized~"
 Sheffield_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Darling~ Good morning! Did you sleep at ease last night? How about, the black tea I recommend is not wrong, it is very soothing after drinking. But you fell asleep so soon, I thought it was a sleeping pill Yeah, hey~"
 Sheffield_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Darling~This is the clothes I chose for you. After you put it on, you will be more like a nobleman. After all, you are also a member of the royal family. You must improve your aesthetics. Okay, take off your clothes. Let me put on new clothes for you~"
 Sheffield_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Of course, a lot of sugar cubes should be added to the black tea~ The sweet taste can wash away the bad luck of the day! What is your look, so funny~ Huhuhu~"
 Sheffield_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Firefly, can you not use my sister as a mirror? Although my sister is very nice, she is also an angry type~ My sister is ten times more terrifying than Hippel!"
 Sheffield_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The destroyers are like dolls, people can't help but want to hug them~ But a little guy ran away as soon as he saw me, probably shy~ hee hee~"
 Sheffield_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Your MajestyHuh? Is it war-weary? I didn’t bring that funny one today...Ahem, I didn’t bring that headgear today, I almost recognized the wrong person. I'm rude, I will retreat~"
 Montpelier_TouchDialog_1:0 "Denver guy, talking about "chivalry" all day long, chirping to death! The battlefield is the place where life and death are decided, there is no time to give you a fair match! No, I must talk about her face to face! "
 Montpelier_TouchDialog_2:0 "What are you looking at? Huh? If you are idle, go over and hold the target and let the recruits hit the moving target. Hey, you are suddenly busy again? What a fickle guy."
 Montpelier_TouchDialog_3:0 "The reason why our Cleveland family is invincible is, of course, because of what we do and can withstand the test of justice. Hey, it doesn’t seem to be a problem to say that we are "partners of justice"~"
 Montpelier_TouchDialog_4:0 "No matter how far away, as long as we receive a distress signal, our "Sea Knights" will go to the rescue! Remember, justice will never be absent! Well... it's just that sometimes you may be late."
 Montpelier_TouchDialog_5:0 ""Knights of the Sea"-it was just a joke at the beginning. Who knows that Denver took her seriously, and she will become like this when she comes back to her mind. Don't tell the eldest sister about it! If she is If you know it, you will definitely join in. That would be a big trouble!"
 Montpelier_TouchDialog_6:0 "I left the seagull's maintenance work to the eldest sister. Why? Because I couldn't do it, I accidentally broke the wing last time, and then Denver trained me all night... Bad memories."
  Montpelier_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Denver, you don't need to be so rigid. The practice between us does not require extra etiquette, so it will expose a lot of flaws. If you are on the battlefield, it is not impossible to be beaten into sandbags."
 Montpelier_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "You are here too, just so, come to help us judge. Don't be distracted, if I get serious, I won't care about the enemy. Then you will ask for more blessings~"
 Montpelier_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Huh~ It feels great to not care about the ammunition reserve! It is called fighting if you want to pour firepower! Let the enemy not have a good part! Hahaha!"
 Montpelier_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Children only read comics! What's so good about that thing? Even if you put thathuh? What's this, it's quite interesting...ah, wait! I haven't finished it yet! Give it to me return!"
 Montpelier_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "As expected of the big sister... completely left us behind! So many bookcases are not duplicated! It's terrible! As expected of our "Sea Knights" the only leader!"
 Montpelier_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The theory of multiverse is too powerful! If all the Cleveland families of parallel universes are brought together, we can protect even the peace of the universe! The stars and the sea! This is the dream of all of us!"
 Denver_TouchDialog_1:0 "The duty of the knight is to rescue the oppressed. If you can't even do this, you won't be regarded as a knight with a title at all."
 Denver_TouchDialog_2:0 "Indeed, I was not honored, and I cannot be called an official "Knight". But I swear by the name "Cleveland"-what I did, I did not insult the name "Knight". Even if not Be recognized, and I will continue."
 Denver_TouchDialog_3:0 "Things are no big or small. As long as we hear the call for help, our "Sea Knights" will rush to the scene. But we have to admit that we can't save everyone. There is a limit to power-no one can avoid it. "Defects" that cannot be opened."
 Denver_TouchDialog_4:0 "The more contemptible and ridiculous a person is, the more he likes to slap his tongue. For those who maliciously slander the honor of the knight, he should start a duel against him. Through the duel, let all this get a fair verdict."
 Denver_TouchDialog_5:0 "Taking care of your own equipment is also one of the knight's rules. If you can't do this little thing well, it's a disqualification in disqualification."
 Denver_TouchDialog_6:0 "Head...I'm sorry, I missed you. Sister Cleveland, what are you reading? It seems to be a very interesting book. Can I watch it with you? Thank you very much, then I will sit next to you..."
 Denver_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sister Montpellier, just because she is a family, she can't neglect etiquette. But since you have said so, let me put aside the etiquette concept this time and give full play to my strength."
 Denver_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "It is incomprehensible to make the bridge so high. If it is to better observe the enemy's situation, it will aggravate one's own danger, and it is not worth the loss."
 Denver_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Master, the exercise is over. As a referee, you have worked hard. Please allow me to massage you to soothe tight muscles and spirit. As far as the massage technique is concerned, I am very confident."
 Denver_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I yearn for interstellar travel, but this is not the time to do this kind of thing. In order to take the world back from those things, we still need to do a lot."
 Denver_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "If you want to get rid of tiredness, high-calorie food is essential. Therefore, I fried some French fries. Master, do you need ketchup? Understand, please wait a moment."

 Hatsuzuki_TouchDialog_1:0 "Whenever a new wish is born in my heart, I will fold a thousand paper cranes~ Now there are two large bottles, it looks very spectacular. Also, two of these wishes have been fulfilled, you Guess what is it?"
 Hatsuzuki_TouchDialog_2:0 "The greedy child is not tall~ If you are too short, you can't be a watchman! But I have radar, so let's be more greedy~!"
 Hatsuzuki_TouchDialog_3:0 "In addition to paper cranes, I also like to collect shells and make them into necklaces~ This way, no matter where the sisters go, as long as I hear the sound of shells, I can welcome them back as soon as possible NS!"
 Hatsuzuki_TouchDialog_4:0 "As long as you take the sword, you have the illusion that you have become a samurai. But that thing is too heavy, it's a shame that my sister can carry it all the time."
 Hatsuzuki_TouchDialog_5:0 "When will Minato be able to hold a festival? Admiral! This is a good opportunity to mingle with others! Maybe you can meet your significant other!"
  Hatsuzuki_TouchDialog_6:0 "The sound just now was...I'm hungry! This time I will use the special cookies made by Sister Ryogyue! Ah! I forgot that the cookies have been fed to Tianhe! Great crisis!!!"
 Hatsuzuki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Eldest sister~ Ah, second sister is here too! Take a look! My new necklace is for you! Put it on, it will be very beautiful~ Look, I said it looks good! "
 Hatsuzuki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Where did you go...oh! Sister, you are here! Give you the watercolor paint that you got from the doctor~ You complained that the paint is not enough recently, I brought it to you specially! Everyone Sister, don’t have to thank you very much~"
 Hatsuzuki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Admiral~What do you want the most? Eh...this, this...then, that, there is an airship!!! Tweethaha, I seem to have read it wrong, eh~"
 Hatsuzuki_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Wow! Something rushed past?! Was it an eagle? Or an owl? How terrible! Why would anyone raise these birds of prey?!"
 Hatsuzuki_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "This kind of thing with one enemy and a hundred is a thing that has been desperate and will do to protect the beloved. Once you make a decision, you will never regret it. Because those beloved are worthy of their lives."
 Hatsuzuki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "No matter what, the chubby ones are always more cute~ Tianhe, don't you think? Eat a little bit more, the biscuits made by Sister Liangyue are very delicious~"
 Phelps_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hi~ Commander, do you have a serious job?... If you need help, call me... Don't worry, don't worry."
 Phelps_TouchDialog_2:0 "Commander, commander... isn’t there? Where did you go...Ah, why is the desk so messy, alas, let me clean it up, so outsiders will see that they will be laughed at..."
 Phelps_TouchDialog_3:0 "Huh-if only the torpedo can be improved, it is not my problem that it always fails..."
 Phelps_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sister Potter is always so lively, so envious, if only I could be like her..."
 Phelps_TouchDialog_5:0 "Ah, Commander, what a coincidence, are you going in this direction too? Then... let's go together, okay?"
 Phelps_TouchDialog_6:0 "It would be great if you can be brave, like Sister Potter, open your heart, open your heart, I can...it’s already this point, Commander, why haven’t you rested yet, I, I’m here Look at the stars, (whispering) One...together?"
 Phelps_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Today's exercise is going to escort Miss Lexington, I am a little nervous... Can I really complete this task? What should I do if Miss Lexington is injured..."
 Phelps_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "It's over, where will the commander be now? Otherwise, just like before, go through all the possible places and you will definitely have a chance to meet! But now, let’s not mention the chance encounter~"
 Phelps_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Commander, my hair is a bit messy~ don't move, it just happens...ah, no, I should say that I knew it would happen, so I brought a comb with me and let me take care of it for you."
 Phelps_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "After the torpedo is launched, there are two states, one is to detonate to destroy the enemy, the other is not to detonate...what is the purpose of the torpedo that is not detonated? Yes, but is it possible to deliberately launch a torpedo that will never detonate to express something...I think too much."
 Phelps_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Actually, apart from the initial encounter, nothing happened between you and me because of a coincidence... No, do I have to say it?"
 Phelps_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Take me out so late, what are you doing?...Huh? You still remember that I liked watching the stars by myself, hehe...Although it was just an excuse back then, I liked you. Proof. That's right, I especially like watching this starry sky with you."
 U1405_TouchDialog_1:0 "Wow-what are you going to do with 1206 today? Is it performing a ride around the port area on a ship? Or is it drinking sea water?...Of course, I will watch the performance of the seniors carefully."
 U1405_TouchDialog_2:0 "Let me help them train? Yes, I will work hard for your face, but you must also dive with me. As a commander, how can you not take the lead? Do you want to be a leader? A trash sir who only speaks?"
 U1405_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hmph, what if I was discovered? Are you low-speed boats chasing me? Are you stupid? I'm leaving!"
 U1405_TouchDialog_4:0 "Would you like to drink a little? Senior 1206, this is a good drink...Huh? I vomited after taking a sip. Why is it so useless? How does the hydrogen peroxide taste? Hehe..."
 U1405_TouchDialog_5:0 "Really, everyone is so boring... Obviously you don't have to be so serious every day... Are you right? Ah, forgot, I'm asking you for nothing..."
 U1405_TouchDialog_6:0 "Hey? The drink is empty, I need to go to Miss Leipzig to get more points... Um-I should not sleep at this time, I don't know if I can get more points this time..."
 U1405_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey! Get up! Do you want me to cook my own breakfast? If you don't make breakfast for me, I'll tell Instructor Ella that you abused me! I'm serious, give you three seconds! 3,2 ,1--!"
 U1405_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The so-called couple is to fly with each other, so you have to do my training together. I don't care whether you buy a diving suit or have a straw in your mouth. Anyway, let me dive training with me!"
 U1405_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I'm training seriously. It's not my fault that they can't catch up with me... It's clear that I'm just an exposed submarine, isn't it that the exposed submarine is very weak? It seems that their strength is just to say That's it."
 U1405_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Am I a vicious tongue? I haven't scolded anyone, do you think I have said you are a trash? Have I said you are a fool? Have I said you are a fool? No, I am People are kind, right?"
 U1405_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Here, hydrogen peroxide, would you like something to drink?...Cut, you don’t have the guts to say that you like me~"
  U1405_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Sir, haven't you slept yet? This is the instruction manual I wrote to the idiot 1206 after checking her ship. Even if she is as stupid as her, I should be able to understand...Okay, I'm exhausted. , I'm going to bed, you remember to give her..."
 Moskva_TouchDialog_1:0 "The shotgun must be polished at all times, the binoculars must be carried with you, and these things that survive in the wild... must be checked at any time... who knows when it will be used."
 Moskva_TouchDialog_2:0 "The ship is equipped with so many extra things...you can still walk, if I were you, I would give up those unnecessary burdens, otherwise I would suffer."
 Moskva_TouchDialog_3:0 "Why do you put weird fillings in the dumplings... I don't understand, the dumplings should be mashed potatoes and dipped in sour cream. This is the real delicacy."
 Moskva_TouchDialog_4:0 "Des Moines? Is that guy strong?...Oh, all this was just before I appeared."
 Moskva_TouchDialog_5:0 "Good hunters should not be dispatched at night, otherwise they may become prey by themselves."
 Moskva_TouchDialog_6:0 "There are only three things to do in the life of a hunter: preparing for the hunt, hunting, and enjoying the prey."
 Moskva_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sit down, today’s breakfast is a good thing I hunted last night, come, taste...Is it any meat?"
 Moskva_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Let's go, I teach you hunting, it's very simple. You can even conquer me, but are you afraid of a few weak animals?"
 Moskva_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Western ladies actually invited me to go swimming at the beach tomorrow, comrade, can you help me choose a swimsuit? With advance notice, I will not lose to anyone in terms of body shape."
 Moskva_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Huh-finally figured it out. Although Des Moines' main gun performance is really scary, but if you consider the main gun roll cycle...her weakness is here...when the time is right, I will defeat her Yes, you can be a witness at that time, comrade."
 Moskva_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I have always wanted to try the princess hug, huh? Stand up, I mean hug you in the princess hug."
 Moskva_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The most suitable dinner for hunters. Naturally, the reclaimed prey is paired with high-concentration spirits. If there is a fire to barbecue, it would be great!"
 Sverdlov_TouchDialog_1:0 "It is a soldier's bounden duty to defend the country. This port area is my second motherland, so I will do my best to protect its peace. Comrades, please rest assured that soldiers will not lie."
 Sverdlov_TouchDialog_2:0 "The days of patrolling the Red Sea are not very busy. But who would have thought that the war came so suddenly, like an iron curtain covering the whole world. Then I came here and returned to the frontline of the battle. ."
 Sverdlov_TouchDialog_3:0 "Well, Sister Moscow is so passionate and breathless every time I hug. Having said that, I am still very happy."
 Sverdlov_TouchDialog_4:0 "The lack of firepower is made up by the rate of fire. Hmm...but I always feel too wasteful. The cost of ammunition supply is also an inescapable expense. Thinking about this, I suddenly don't want to fire..."
 Sverdlov_TouchDialog_5:0 "Will missiles be better than torpedoes? After all, it’s this age, and it’s always weird to be equipped with torpedoes...sorry, Comrade Kiev, I didn’t mean it."
 Sverdlov_TouchDialog_6:0 "Even the proud colleagues in the West are full of praise for my equipment. Can you imagine the scene when these main guns fire at the same time? It will definitely make you full of praise."
 Sverdlov_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "If you want to kill time, I have many good ideas. But these are bad habits left over from the peaceful era, but I am so proud... Comrade, please punish me."
 Sverdlov_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Kiroff is an admirable predecessor. Thanks to her successful design concept, I have me...sounds like a mother-daughter relationship? Yes, she must be very suitable for the role of "mother", no ?"
 Sverdlov_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Comrade, do you want me to take you out to sea? I assure you that this journey will be very interesting. Proper ventilation is a regulator that allows the body and mind to undergo more severe tests."
 Sverdlov_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Unfortunately, "Anjie" did not follow. Its fishing skills must be very popular here. Comrades, why can't the brown bear pass?"
 Sverdlov_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Wrist-wrenching also requires skill. Brute force alone will only make the table collapse. But sometimes, it's still-Sister Moscow, it hurts so much, I give up."
 Sverdlov_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The "candlelight dinner" without candlelight looks so shabby. Why don't you pour this bottle of wine on a plate and light it on fire instead? Is it too wasteful...also, it's because I didn't think about it well. I'm sorry, comrade."
 AlbertodiGiussano_TouchDialog_1:0 "Our mercenaries are wandering around looking for people who are willing to hire themselves... Fortunately, I met you. Your ingenuity, bravery and decisiveness attracted me. I wanted to take the initiative to stay and help you, how? So, hire me to do something today?"
 AlbertodiGiussano_TouchDialog_2:0 "The customer is God, facing the enemy of God, our mercenaries will not have the slightest mercy and kindness, please rest assured~"
 AlbertodiGiussano_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hunting destroyers is my special skill, as long as I sneak up to them quietly, and then sing "The destroyer, please open the door~", you can take it down~"
  AlbertodiGiussano_TouchDialog_4:0 "The group of people in Germany really like to drink. It is said that everyone's impression of mercenaries is to drink beer and smoke cigarettes, and then squander the hard-earned bounty...No, no, I'm not that kind of person , The reward is hard to come by, I don’t want to spend it easily."
 AlbertodiGiussano_TouchDialog_5:0 "Hee hee~ The officer is really good, he just said a few good things and he got the bait, there is no way, smile is the strongest weapon... It seems that this port area can stay a little longer, after all, so kind Lovely sir, I still want to molest more~"
 AlbertodiGiussano_TouchDialog_6:0 "The mercenaries often live the life of licking blood, both in life and in life like walking a tightrope. Although I often call myself a hunter, it is hard to tell if I am too cute to be prey to others. You Say yes... hee hee, sir~ officer~ big~ man~ blushing~"
 AlbertodiGiussano_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I prepared a rich breakfast for you today. As a reward, please give me a loving and affectionate kiss. Hurry up~ I'm ready."
 AlbertodiGiussano_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Are you busy? Seeing that you have been in the same posture for several hours recently, your body must be very stiff, let me rub your shoulders and pound your back... In return... (whispering) You will give me this evening. Do these."
 AlbertodiGiussano_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Let me see where the gorgeously dressed little girl hides?... Hee hee, the bag exposes you, Vlta, come out, I'm a very kind and gentle person, I won't be right What do you do."
 AlbertodiGiussano_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Do you have a good study of the technique of beating your back and squeezing your shoulders? Isn't it just a perfunctory double-click, and I want to teach you? It's for a fee! First... First, bring me a cup of hot milk, two people Don’t forget your share!"
 AlbertodiGiussano_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Yo~ Pompeii, you are not happy when I bullied Volta? Let me see where the arrogant little guy attracts you... okay, okay, I know this guy is your good opponent , I won’t disturb the two of you. Goodbye, great Miss Pompeii~ Have a nice evening."
 AlbertodiGiussano_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "When I first met you, I just thought it was fun to tease you. I didn't expect... You actually have such a careful mind. I am the mercenary captain who fell into your hands. Anyway, I will be with you in the future. I really can't get up after this planting."
 ViribusUnitis_TouchDialog_1:0 "Well...this kind of place is Yu's residence? Not to mention, Yu only needs a place to stay, and the front line is Yu's permanent "home"."
 ViribusUnitis_TouchDialog_2:0 "For the sake of you taking care of Yu's territory, Yu will designate you as a general. In the future, I will work hard to guard Yu's territory-take Yu to see Yu's soldiers, General."
 ViribusUnitis_TouchDialog_3:0 "Is this the scientific research department? Who is the person in charge? As a subsidiary of the rest, you can make things first in the world! Oh, fanfare, are you in charge?"
 ViribusUnitis_TouchDialog_4:0 "What's the matter, General? Is this physically exhausted? It seems that you have to deduct some of your score. That's it, that's it for today. I will go shopping by myself, and you can withdraw."
 ViribusUnitis_TouchDialog_5:0 "Well, this garden is so beautiful and unique. Um... the person in front looks familiar? Elizabeth? Is it Yu Elizabeth?!"
 ViribusUnitis_TouchDialog_6:0 "Isn't this Prince Eugen? Yu's sister, even if her appearance changes, this bloodline will remain the same. Come, follow Yu, it's time to go home."
 ViribusUnitis_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 ""Viribus Unitis"Yu's favorite motto is also Yu Zhiwei's name. Being stuck on the order is too small, general. It is because of Yu's existence that it has left a strong mark in history. The mark, isn't it?"
 ViribusUnitis_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Sister, who is the "Wildcat" next to you? You are the crown prince, and you can't stay with the unknown-wait, this smell...is the smelly pirate of country G?!"
 ViribusUnitis_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Yu is the owner of the world's first three-pack main gun. In other words, what Yu has is the original version of all three-pack main guns. The rest are just a bunch of fakes."
 ViribusUnitis_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Please wait, Elizabeth! Oh, Queen Yu, finally let Yu find you. Your graceful posture and this beautiful face are unforgettable for Yu Yongshi. Yu decided, let the general build for you A luxurious palace!"
 ViribusUnitis_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Queen Yu, Yu always wanted to ask, why are you dressed so shabby? Is the general wronging you? No problem, Yu will give you one of the most magnificent dresses in the world. Only in this way can I match you-Queen Yu , Elizabeth."
 ViribusUnitis_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "In front of you, even the moonlight looks so dim. Queen Yu, Yu can even give up the entire territory for you if you want to. Promise Yu not to leave Yu again. Everything that Yu has is Not as good as you. Elizabeth, I beg you"
 Elli_TouchDialog_1:0 "Anyway, I am the only ship of the Elli class, and it seems that I am not so famous. It is okay for me to call myself a Yingrui class III ship..."
  Elli_TouchDialog_2:0 "There is one thing I have been holding in my heart for a long time...that is, it was the first time I met. I am really sorry for your impatient attitude. The main reason was that I was thinking of meeting Ying Rui and Zhao. Sister and sister... got too excited, although I know you won't take it to heart, but if I don't apologize, it will be very uncomfortable."
 Elli_TouchDialog_3:0 "Although Sister Ying Rui and Sister Zhaohe look similar, they are completely opposite in character, but the last time I met Ping Hai, she told me not to go to Sister Ying Rui in the middle of the night, why..."
 Elli_TouchDialog_4:0 "Senior Evlov is a great hero of the Greek people, but she is very friendly. When I first arrived in Greece, she often had a temper, but she has always been very tolerant to me... Now think about it, at that time It's so naive."
 Elli_TouchDialog_5:0 "Senior Evlov will tell me some Greek mythology every night, but every time I fall asleep before listening to it...it’s a pity that I don’t know the Chinese mythology at all, otherwise I can give it the other way around. She said..."
 Elli_TouchDialog_6:0 "There is a girl in the port area who looks like me. Do you know her name? I ran into it by accident on the road today, but it seems to be from Italy... I didn't dare to talk to her."
 Elli_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Chinese-style breakfast...Chinese-style breakfast...I am also half a Chinese navy girl, this thing can't trouble me...this, how do I do this thing!"
 Elli_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Every time I want to be lazy in training, I will look at Senior Eflov, and then I feel that being lazy is embarrassing, so I don’t dare to be lazy..."
 Elli_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "What can I do to be as good as the predecessors...or I can't do it because of my talent..."
 Elli_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Admiral...Admiral...Um... I think Sister Ying Rui and Sister Zhaohe call you that way. It doesn't matter if I call you that way... Are you still asleep? I want to hear stories, I want to know more about China Folk tales, rest assured, I will never fall asleep!"
 Elli_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I read an ancient Chinese poem today. I am a stranger in a foreign land alone. Every holiday season I miss my relatives... Suddenly I have a new understanding of the original feeling."
 Elli_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Although I don't know what they have experienced, I can feel that Sister Ying Rui and Sister Zhaohe should have endured the pain that ordinary people can't bear before they have come to today..."
 Haguro_TouchDialog_1:0 "It's terrible... Why is there dust even here? It's better to put the ship away when you don't need to attack... Or just get some special coating? Oh... Let's get the dust off first. "
 Haguro_TouchDialog_2:0 "...what's the matter? Don't pretend to look familiar to us. Only you, I will never agree-the flagship of the fifth team, it can only be her."
 Haguro_TouchDialog_3:0 "This kid, please wait a moment-according to Article 381 of the Port Code, all ship-mounted weapon systems should remain silent in the event of a non-red alert. You did not do this, right? Please follow me to the police office."
 Haguro_TouchDialog_4:0 ""Dragon"? A creature with scales...it feels dirty just thinking about it. Please don't talk about it anymore, I'm afraid I will spit it out...that kind of thing, let it only exist in fantasy In it..."
 Haguro_TouchDialog_5:0 "This is a summary of my work today, please go through it. Hey? Isn't this necessary anymore? I can handle these things by myself...? I don't know...I should be happy or sad... ..."
 Haguro_TouchDialog_6:0 "Admiral, here is your schedule for tomorrow. Please be sure to attend on time. These activities are not only to consolidate your reputation, but also to build the image of the port. Do you understand?"
 Haguro_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Working hard is a good thing, but your injury has not healed. If you overdraw your body, you may not be able to go to the battlefield again. You should pay attention to recuperation, and please rest assured-no one can replace your seat."
 Haguro_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Admiral, regarding the schedule, I want to confirm with you-what's the extra "travel" here? Hey? Come with me? "Honeymoon trip"... yes yes, yes I, I, I will be ready!"
 Haguro_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sister! I want to ask... What is the "honeymoon trip" for? Really... That's the way it is. That... Can you give me some advice? I have no idea about this kind of thing. ..."
  Haguro_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Ship, Captain!...Are you scared? That...I think, since the oath has already been made, it doesn’t matter if you change your name... Or do you think this is not intimate enough...? Uh... the others can't be said at all..."
 Haguro_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Captain, I brought it for you-wait a minute, don't move! Why are there ink marks on the collar?! Why are you so careless... Take it off, I'll wash it for you-no! This is a very important thing! It must be cleaned up right away! Right away, right away!"
 Haguro_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 ""Witch"-holding a weird walking stick and secretly cursing annoying people... Probably that's it? So, there seems to be someone in the port that fits this description? Ah, I mean appearance With all these costumes, she didn't say that she was a secretive tricker!"
 Amatsukaze_TouchDialog_1:0 "I am a substitute for the will of heaven, the nightmare of the abyss-when my task is completed, I will go to the next area. Just like my name, wind is unconstrained."
 Amatsukaze_TouchDialog_2:0 "This equipment was made for me by heavenly man. As for the outfit... it is a personal hobby and has no special meaning. What? Do you have any comments?"
 Amatsukaze_TouchDialog_3:0 "As the lord, are you really managing your own territory? I didn't mean to find fault. Anyway, the restaurant has only six seats, is it too outrageous?"
 Amatsukaze_TouchDialog_4:0 "Night is the favorite time of the abyss, you can't relax your vigilance. Huh? Why is there a high concentration of M particles around here? The recognition signal is pink... Could it be that"
 Amatsukaze_TouchDialog_5:0 "The devas once said that if this set of equipment is further strengthened, even air combat will be no problem. Coupled with the particle light blade, I am afraid that no abyss can escape from my hands."
 Amatsukaze_TouchDialog_6:0 "Don’t be funny, Lord. It’s the will of the heavenspuff...cough, I yawned just now, it doesn’t count. Why? Are you suspicious of me? Look into my eyes and say it again ?"
 Amatsukaze_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The reaction of the M particle is getting stronger and stronger...Gum!? It turned out to be the "Flash Destroyer"Shimakaze! Uh-oh-oh-oh! Senior! Wait for me!"
 Amatsukaze_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Oh lord, I think it is necessary to improve the food of my compatriots. If you limit the number of meals, how can you ensure the maximum combat power! Excellent fighters need to eat at least six meals a day!"
 Amatsukaze_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Oh, isn't this an ineffective eldest sister? She doesn't look like she has grown up either. Grumbling! What kind of "hypothesis"?! I'm a substitute for the will of heaven"
 Amatsukaze_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Senior Shimakaze! It's me, don't you recognize me? Hum...it must have been brainwashed by those hateful abysses! Come to think of it! You are one of the strongest fighters in the Federation! !"
 Amatsukaze_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Unexpectedly, there is also a devas laboratory here...Doctor, are you the devas here? Please upgrade my equipment! The stronger the better!"
 Amatsukaze_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh, is it a game of kings? I dare to challenge me who is the strongest warrior. I am worthy of being a lord, I am worthy of being a lord. Say in advance, I am extraordinary, often, and strong!"
 Ro-34_TouchDialog_1:0 "Walking is troublesome... I still prefer to stay underwater, swimming is the most convenient way of action in the world!"
 Ro-34_TouchDialog_2:0 "I don't need vegetables! Especially round vegetables! Don't even get malnourished!"
 Ro-34_TouchDialog_3:0 "I would never do something like a naval gun against the target. Because the back will get cold inexplicably..."
  Ro-34_TouchDialog_4:0 "Small size is not a bad thing, it will be more flexible when avoiding deep bomb attacks. However, I still want to grow taller!"
 Ro-34_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sister Big Whale! I'll help you pack things! Hey, don't worry, I can still do this kind of thing-earth and earth wow!!!"
 Ro-34_TouchDialog_6:0 "Admiral...that, is the plate a very expensive thing? I accidentally broke some-I, I will compensate! Let me do anything!"
 Ro-34_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I seem to be watched...? I always feel a chill behind me. I have a refrigerator behind me? This joke is too cold, Admiral...Wow, there is it!?"
 Ro-34_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "There is a person in Minato who holds potatoes all day...? Just listening to it makes people get goosebumps! It's horrible! Huh? It's behind me? The same thing can't happen Wow! It's really here ah ah ah ah ah ah!!!"
 Ro-34_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Admiral, do you want to go to the sea to play? Can't dive? It doesn't matter ~ you just hold me! But don't touch me, I'm afraid of itching. Really can't!"
 Ro-34_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "What happens when you are hungry underwater? You have a lot of strange questions. Of course it is to catch a passing fish and eat it-lie to you~ Wait, you don't really believe it, right? It's a lie, let me explain!"
 Ro-34_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "French fries... is made of potatoes? Lie! Don't think that I don't know this is a potato after changing the name! I would never eat a bite even if I had to stay on land every day! Huh!"
 Ro-34_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "...It's delicious. This thing turned out to be-oh oh oh, admiral, you are back! Uh? What's wrong? Nothing happened?"
 Tiger_TouchDialog_1:0 "When you look around, there are some guys who are behind the times. You are really pitiful. If you want me to say, I will try my best to develop new models, such as my type, so that all battles can be easily handled. How about Think about it."
 Tiger_TouchDialog_2:0 "Huh, the heart of awe? You have beaten me in a fair duel, and I admit that you are a great senior. Don't flash to the waist, old, senior, senior"
 Tiger_TouchDialog_3:0 "This is a genuine crown and a symbol of royal power! Humph, just respect me. Otherwise, I will let you taste the wrath of the king of Great Britain-oh! Are you scared?"
 Tiger_TouchDialog_4:0 "Cut...that kind of tea party, I don't envy it at all. It's that they don't deserve me, it's not that I'm excluded. Wait...I won't really beimpossible! I don't admit it!"
 Tiger_TouchDialog_5:0 "Don't treat me as a child! Look at my perfect figure and beauty, like a stinky kid?! Hmph, just recognize the mistakes, I will show mercy and forgive you. The sin of ritual."
 Tiger_TouchDialog_6:0 "My people, come to gather around me! Good deed~ This is the big fish caught today. Eat slowly and don’t fight. Ah~ it’s so cute, so cute~"
 Tiger_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Listen! From now on, we will catch all the thieves who stole food! The reward is canned salmon and tuna! My people, show your strength, go!"
 Tiger_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "You! Don't look at others! Even if you give orders, you don't have to stare at them! Hmph, tell me the instructions, it's the same for me to pass them on. If you stare at others, I will Put your eyeballs--understand, okay, do you?"
 Tiger_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The little girl with glasses over there! Why did you run away when you heard my name! I can't take this kind of disrespectful behavior as not happening! If I caught me, I would perm your hair. Spiral volume!"
 Tiger_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Miss Belfast, you are blowing pipes here again. Yes, I miss my life in England too. But life is not bad now. I always feel very happy to have a commander as a fool. Ah...what am I talking about..."
 Tiger_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hey...? Desserts for me? Really... You stupid is surprisingly affectionate... I'm not complimenting you! Why don't you come here soon? I'm going to starve to death! Feed mehurry up, hurry up!"
 Tiger_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "My people, you have accomplished the task brilliantly! This is a good reward-dear ~ everyone is a good boy. Oh, do you want me to touch your belly? Really, yes, Yes, love~"
 K1_TouchDialog_1:0 "What a troublesome ship outfit... The best time to assassinate is always fleeting..."
 K1_TouchDialog_2:0 "Miss Glory, although I know that you are often stupid, but I also hope you can notice that our submarine is actually surrounding you when you move forward... If you hit it, it will be very painful..."
 K1_TouchDialog_3:0 "Why can't we move freely around the ocean like a U-boat... The tactical thinking of Country E seems to need to be reformed."
 K1_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, do you think mermaids really exist?... The first person who created the concept of mermaids is really a great artist."
 K1_TouchDialog_5:0 "It is safest to travel at night, no one can see me."
 K1_TouchDialog_6:0 "M1, M2, you are a bit too noisy...really, can't you be more mature?"
 K1_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Commander, I want to make a signal transmitter for my sisters so that everyone will not collide with each other when they go out... Can you help me?"
 K1_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Playing with pistols is just my hobby... I like the heroes in the movie who go everywhere with a gun, Commander, how about you?"
  K1_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Miss Glory...Here, this is a sender I designed. As long as I'm nearby, it will flicker. The faster it flickers, the closer you are...hope and hope to help you."
 K1_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "M1 and M2 have fun playing with their ship outfits every time...My ship outfit...So, Commander, you stand here, yes, hold this apple in your hand and put it on your head... Don't shake , This is my unique skill."
 K1_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Um... It's no big deal to call you here, but I recently learned a new swimming style. I heard people say it looks good... I want to show it to you first... Don't say it!"
 K1_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Feelings... this thing is hard to understand, it's too much trouble, just completing tasks every day is already very tired...but I don't mind you telling it to me."
 Constellation_TouchDialog_1:0 "I am the second ship of the Lexington class! Is there any rules for the little girl in Saratoga... Quickly, Commander, call her, I will confront her!"
 Constellation_TouchDialog_2:0 "Miss Hood, hehe, I heard that the country E has a training plan specifically based on battlecruisers. I wonder if I can also participate in it? Don't worry, I will never make trouble."
 Constellation_TouchDialog_3:0 "Ah, you are here, Commander. I'm watching my sister's training. Look, my sister is really good!... Hey, you said... If I had better grades, would I be by her side? Will it be me?"
 Constellation_TouchDialog_4:0 "Huhthe U Navy’s design has almost no battlecruiser combat ideas... And E’s navy doesn’t pay much attention to the cooperative tactics of aircraft carriers and battle cruisers... Do I really want to think about it? Really a headache? ."
 Constellation_TouchDialog_5:0 "It's cute, right? This is my messenger. As long as you see it, it proves that I'm there."
 Constellation_TouchDialog_6:0 "Saratoga’s little Nizi isn’t so good... There’s something wrong with the ship’s outfit. If I hadn’t done that... Hmph, don’t believe me, I want to keep up with my sister, But a lot of effort has been made."
 Constellation_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Saratoga...huh, it's considered a chance for me. I have mastered the skills to deal with aircraft carriers, this time I will make you never look up...ah, sister, it's all right, next time Do you want to take me with you? I'm very strong."
 Constellation_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "That's...huh, Saratoga, I finally found you, attacked and escaped with the advantage of speed...what? This group of people are moving in the direction of the sister?... Oh, hateful! This can only be... Hello! You guys, are you going in the wrong direction? Saratoga, Miss Constellation is coming to punish you personally!"
 Constellation_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Those guys...King Kong? Commander, is the blond and white guy very strong?...If I defeat her... will it prove my strength?"
 Constellation_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "When I was young, because I didn’t like training, I couldn’t do anything to compare to Saratoga... So she became an aircraft carrier next to her sister, a sister praised by everyone in the port area... But after that, she did it again. There must be a competitor. Hey, I won’t say so many discouraging words!"
 Constellation_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Alaska and Guam are going to have a concert tonight. I got two tickets for the first row by personal relationship. Let's go together, hey, rest assured, I will never regret it!"
 Constellation_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Commander, you see, the stars in the sky seem to be illogically arranged, but they have become constellations one after another under human research. Like them, I will have a unique story...beginner How do you write it? From a long, long time ago..."
 Zhguchiy_TouchDialog_1:0 "Please note, comrades, this launcher is very heavy and complicated, and must be operated in strict accordance with the manual."
 Zhguchiy_TouchDialog_2:0 "Always involuntarily want to follow the aircraft carrier and them quietly."
 Zhguchiy_TouchDialog_3:0 "Sister Kirov?! I am so excited to see you, you are my role model."
 Zhguchiy_TouchDialog_4:0 "You haven't rested so late. What am I doing? In order to be able to use the launcher smoothly and smartly, I often use logs to practice operations and exercise my strength by the way."
 Zhguchiy_TouchDialog_5:0 "Yeah!? Ooooooo...It turned out to be you, comrade, don't make jokes suddenly behind me, okay, I was so scared that I lifted you up and circled..."
 Zhguchiy_TouchDialog_6:0 "Every time I read about the glorious deeds of the ancestors during the war, I feel passionate. Especially the flagship of the Battle of Heroes City, Sister Kirov, I admire her too much."
 Zhguchiy_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Does it feel hot, wait a moment. Okay, give me your hand..."
 Zhguchiy_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ahem, every time I launch a missile, I get blown up and messed up. Will my hair be tied up like this a lot better?"
 Zhguchiy_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Every time I argue about equipment development, I can't compete with Minsk and the others... next time we discuss it, dear, help me convince them."
 Zhguchiy_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Afraid of the dark night? I don't deny this shortcoming, so my dear should accompany me to overcome this shortcoming."
 Zhguchiy_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Well... you have been watching the sisters during the exercise today, but you didn't notice that I broke the opposite flagship."
 Zhguchiy_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Honey, this is using me as a heater... let me raise my body temperature and lean so tightly. No, I don't want to, I like it like this very much."
 Canarias_TouchDialog_1:0 "It's so big~ it's like a small town. There are so many people...oh, this is not good. Don't say hello to me-oh!? Hello, you! "
 Canarias_TouchDialog_2:0 "You should have found out...? Regarding the fact that I can't remember the person's name...Yes, I can remember the person's appearance, but I can't remember the name. The heretics cursed, right?!"
 Canarias_TouchDialog_3:0 "When I was serving elsewhere, because I couldn't remember the name, I hit allies several times... But the people above didn't punish me for it. It's weird..."
 Canarias_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hey?! Do you need my help? No, no problem! Bring this cat to Hood? Hey? Wait! Who is Hood?! At least tell me about his appearance--"
 Canarias_TouchDialog_5:0 "Blonde...this range is too wide, right? Woo...Sister, are you Hood? Hey?! Why run? I just want to hear "yes" or "no"! I'm really not a kidnapper, let alone a pirate!"
 Canarias_TouchDialog_6:0 "As long as it is your instructions, I will execute them. After all, I am a "treaty" re-patrolling. Your words are a treaty to me, and are orders that must be followed. Hey? Isn't it understood that way?"
 Canarias_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Private server? Hey...I don't have that kind of clothes. The closet is all the same uniform, which is the one I am wearing now. To say why...I don't have money..."
 Canarias_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "When I was serving elsewhere, I had never heard of the concept of "salary". It was satisfying to eat just enough every day... Now that I have a salary, I don't know what to do with it. Hmm , It's really a headache."
 Canarias_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Cold soup is a must to dispel the summer heat! Not only is it easy to make, but the ingredients needed are also very cheap. Tomatoes are simply the savior of summer! Honey, do you want to eat it? I will make it now. !"
 Canarias_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The relationship between the sister ships in the port area is really good... Because I can't remember the name, the child has been alienating me. I really want to hear the child call me "sister", oh..."
 Canarias_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The prom... a desirable place. But when I go there in a uniform, will I be called old fashioned? Hey?! Would you like to buy an evening dress for me? This is unnecessary expenses... honey , Cost you money."
 Canarias_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I have never learned to dance... I can only follow your steps. Also, thank you, dear. I can realize this whim of my thought... With you, there will be no regrets. ."
 MendezNunez_TouchDialog_1:0 "Although there is a small fight in the port area, there is no civil strife. It's amazing... You can command so many navy girls, you are much better than I thought."
 MendezNunez_TouchDialog_2:0 "Force can never completely subdue others, and neutrality can never solve any problems."
 MendezNunez_TouchDialog_3:0 "Ah, it's you, general, shhh, keep your voice down... I'm secretly learning Miss Atlanta's combat skills. The structure of her ship and I are very similar. I should be able to learn a lot."
 MendezNunez_TouchDialog_4:0 "Is today's work finished? Let me check it...please give me the next work report in this format, this time I will complete it for you, please come by yourself in the future."
 MendezNunez_TouchDialog_5:0 "Soldiers, be more serious when you go to work, of course you can be more casual after work...Speaking of which, you don’t seem to have any alcoholic beverages here."
 MendezNunez_TouchDialog_6:0 "I usually choose neutral before distinguishing justice from evil, but if I know that evil is raging and I choose to be neutral or help the evil, that kind of people cannot be forgiven even if they are seniors."
 MendezNunez_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "How to make the cold soup...Will there be so much tomato and garlic? If it needs to be improved...How to replace it with a suitable one...Well-the taste should be okay, the next thing to do is to wait for the general to get up NS."
 MendezNunez_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ahhhhh i am to look for and find...fortunately I bought a beer in advance.
 MendezNunez_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I bought two bullfighting tickets, do you want to go see it together?...Actually, I once wanted to be an excellent matador, until one time I found that a cow always looks at my hair and gets angry..."
 MendezNunez_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Always vigilant is the basic consciousness of a soldier, so please be sure to notify me when you travel in the future. It is my duty to protect you."
 MendezNunez_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Richelieu is a lucky man. Even if he is betrayed and exiled overseas, he still has a chance to rejuvenate his country. But I was betrayed by my cronies and almost lost my opponent... if I had a group of trustworthy people. What a good friend, of course, I have you now."
 MendezNunez_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I bought some alcoholic beverages and put them in the refrigerator. You can take them anytime you want to drink. Of course, remember to save some for me."
 Nautilus_TouchDialog_1:0 "Submarine not only has torpedoes, the main gun of submarine can also cause great damage to the enemy when used properly."
 Nautilus_TouchDialog_2:0 "When the battle is stuck, it is more necessary to attack decisively to help teammates break the deadlock."
 Nautilus_TouchDialog_3:0 "Galatia, don't panic when you are attacked by friendly forces. First find a way to emit a signal light. If it doesn't work, you can quickly escape from their attack range and wait for them to calm down... In this regard, I can give you a lot of advice. ."
 Nautilus_TouchDialog_4:0 "Only exploration can you know the answer. If you don't try it, how can you know if it can be done."
 Nautilus_TouchDialog_5:0 "The light is projected through the sea level on the quiet seabed, and the colors are so beautiful."
  Nautilus_TouchDialog_6:0 "This broken torpedo... When can it be improved... This is too easy to malfunction... Otherwise, I will definitely get more results just now."
 Nautilus_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Compared to being a photographer, I still want to be a nurse...probably because I left a good impression when I was young. Of course, the more important reason is that it is really stupid to treat hobbies as work."
 Nautilus_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Huh-it's hot, let's go to the beach to swim... That is, the mackerel and archerfish... me, me... how should I talk to them..."
 Nautilus_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Although I was told that the submarine would never have friends around me since I was young, the U-boats of country G are very united...I really envy it, I don't know if I can have a good relationship with the big mackerel archer..."
 Nautilus_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Would you like a glass of champagne?...I like the taste of champagne very much. If you wipe it on the barrel, there will be a different fragrance, which is very charming."
 Nautilus_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It doesn't matter whether you trust others or not. Because I only trust you."
 Nautilus_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Commander, look at your appearance... Are you afraid of the dark? Don't be afraid, I have been standing by your side, holding your hand like this, will it be better?"
 UlrichvonHutten_TouchDialog_1:0 "It is the body, not the soul, that is imprisoned. No matter how cruel punishment is, the soldier's soul cannot be surrendered. Only a coward can wagging his tail to the enemy."
 UlrichvonHutten_TouchDialog_2:0 "Ezio has followed me since childhood. There is no secret between us. Although it can't express its thoughts in words, I know what it is thinking. This is also a tacit understanding between us, isn't it?"
 UlrichvonHutten_TouchDialog_3:0 "The cooperation between comrades is a measure of whether a team is qualified. Reality is not poetry. Personal heroism will only harm others and yourself. Understand? Working together-is the rule of survival on the battlefield. "
 UlrichvonHutten_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hindenburg, it's time for you to converge. They are our comrades in arms. To understand and save this world, anyone's power is indispensable. Let go of your self-esteem and join the team."
 UlrichvonHutten_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sir, there is something I can do for you, please do not hesitate to tell me. If it is paperwork, that is my strengths for Ezio and me. Don't worry, there will be no mistakes. Right, old Dude."
 UlrichvonHutten_TouchDialog_6:0 "This... is Hood’s cat. Little guy, do you remember me? Let me take you to find the master. Don’t worry the person who loves you. Ji Jingen, give it to him One position, you first tell Hood to let her not worry, we will be there soon."
 UlrichvonHutten_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Too sloppy! What a decent way! The body given to you by the motherland is not for sunbathing! From now on, you will run for 20 kilometers! Get moving, you lazy stag beetles!"
 UlrichvonHutten_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The sentiment...? Although I can write romantic verses, but the subject is myself, I feel a little at a loss... Your sir, have you disappointed?"
 UlrichvonHutten_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I can't accept myself like that, I hope you can forgive me... When the world is restored to peace, we will be able to walk on the beach like normal partners, nestling under the stars. Yes, it must--"
 UlrichvonHutten_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Albrecht, have you collected the information I want? Thank you for your hard work, this is a reward. Next, go with me to supervise the training of the soldiers. If anyone dares to be lazy, use your paw to give her some points. Look at the color."
 UlrichvonHutten_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "We may not be able to live the life of a normal partner until we complete the great goal. But only now, can you hug me? Give me the courage to move on. Wellthat’s good... ..."
 UlrichvonHutten_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Since then, I have been thinking...One day, they will catch you, so that the port area will fall into chaos... For the first time in my life... I felt fear... In order not to let this If something happens, I will do my best to protect you, even if... torn apart..."
 Seydlitz_TouchDialog_1:0 "Senior Mo Qi is also in Minato?... Great, I have many things to ask her."
 Seydlitz_TouchDialog_2:0 "The desire to survive is the basic human instinct, and only by living can you do more things you want to do. This is what Senior Goben taught me."
 Seydlitz_TouchDialog_3:0 "Sir, what are the arrangements for today?... What about me? What needs to be done?"
 Seydlitz_TouchDialog_4:0 "Although these fish can't make a sound, they have been with them for a long time, and they gradually feel that they can blend in with them."
 Seydlitz_TouchDialog_5:0 "Tactics are the key to victory and defeat, but I don't like to learn these difficult things. The command will be left to you and Senior Mo Qi, and I can charge."
 Seydlitz_TouchDialog_6:0 "Even if you want to rest, don't be too slack. I heard that someone was attacked by someone in the port just because he likes to sleep late. I don't know who is so embarrassed..."
 Seydlitz_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sukhbaatar! Stop for me! Don't run! The fish here are not what you can catch!"
  Seydlitz_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Protect teammates and bear the pain alone...every time I think so, I feel that what I do is exceptionally great. What about you, what do you think of me?"
 Seydlitz_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "What do you want for breakfast? I do... Forget it, it's weird to say that... You teach me how to make breakfast, if you don't have a headache..."
 Seydlitz_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Sir, would you like some fish food to feed them? Don't be afraid, they are cute, I can feel them, they like you as much as I do."
 Seydlitz_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Scapa Bay is a very comfortable place, where I can put down all guards and go to rest... If you have time, the sir will come with me."
 Seydlitz_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "War will always shed blood and sacrifice, but I promise you that I will live, after all, this is my unique skill."
 LordClive_TouchDialog_1:0 "A person's status is not only determined by innateness. Even a gangster, even if he is born in a wealthy family, is just a pompous rogue with status. Noble people can make themselves noble no matter where they are. Don't underestimate people's efforts. "
 LordClive_TouchDialog_2:0 "Battle also has its own aesthetics. It is a collection of visual, auditory, and sensory art. It is the aesthetics of combat to do meaningful behavior on the battlefield and fight in a meaningful form."
 LordClive_TouchDialog_3:0 "Miss Maryland's battle is very exciting. The bloody and violent appearance hides disdain for the enemy. The form of Vietnam and the more courageous and Jedi counterattack is like an epic to enjoy. I admire her very much."
 LordClive_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, let us continue the previous discussion, what is the art of fighting, let us reach a consensus in the conversation. How?"
 LordClive_TouchDialog_5:0 "Although the admiral’s battle is elegant and calm, he lacks his own characteristics. Trying to cover his inner anxiety with perfect tactics and gorgeous appearance, this can only be said to be a compromise."
 LordClive_TouchDialog_6:0 "The Germans never understood that the reason for their failure was not poor protection, not small tonnage, but not big guns."
 LordClive_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "My combat philosophy is to kill with one hit. You can't fire casually at any time. No matter how urgent the situation is, you must keep your head calm. You only need to fire once to solve the war."
 LordClive_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Visit the port area is a very important job, will you go with me? How about?"
 LordClive_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Ahem-as a lord, how can I easily go to the battlefield... The ancient emperor's imperial conquest is a very stupid thing. If I get caught, I will lose every game, so I only go where I must win. , Only appear at critical moments."
 LordClive_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Even if it is between you and me, there will inevitably be disputes. At this time, avoidance is not a good solution. The dispute can only be settled by the communication between the two parties. So, if you have anything to do with my words and deeds Please feel free to say where you disagree, and I will discuss it with you."
 LordClive_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The starry sky is so beautiful, no amount of light on the surface can conceal their brilliance... So are you, even in front of us such excellent ship maidens, you will not lose the wind at all."
 LordClive_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "What is your reason and philosophy for fighting? Can you share it with me?"
 Illustrious_TouchDialog_1:0 "Research in any field can help you. My sisters must have proven this."
 Illustrious_TouchDialog_2:0 "Perseverance, you can't always laugh at the shortcomings of others, being good at discovering the strengths of others will make you more lovable."
 Illustrious_TouchDialog_3:0 "Senior Ark Royal, it is an honor to see you again. I am relieved to see that you are so healthy. I have worked hard for you all these years, and I will try my best to help you all afterwards."
 Illustrious_TouchDialog_4:0 "The moonlight in the night sky just uses some power from the sun to light up the dark curtain. The moon is like this, so can human beings."
 Illustrious_TouchDialog_5:0 "Awesome, terrible... Have you bury your head in the experiment again?... If I don't come out again, I will be angry, and I promised to have a combat meeting tonight. You are already late!"
 Illustrious_TouchDialog_6:0 "The bright moonlight reminds me of that wonderful night in Taranto. The lights are bright, and the stars and moon shine together."
 Illustrious_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Do you like humans? I like humans very much, and I like you as a human."
 Illustrious_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "These magics can temporarily give life to these little guys. I have quietly tried their airplanes before. It was quite successful. Do you like these cute little guys?"
 Illustrious_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Miss Veneto, I will not accept your provocation. Frontal combat is not my strong point, but...if you accept the group exercise, I don't mind another surprise attack."
 Illustrious_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The power went out? Don't panic... Let me try... Although this level of light still doesn't work, it's nice to let me see your face clearly."
 Illustrious_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The weather is getting colder, you should also pay attention to it... You see, this tea is cold, drinking it is not good for your health, let me help you warm it up... Don’t worry, it will be better soon, you don’t have to wait too long. ."
 Illustrious_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Only by gathering enough light can it be given to others. I don’t know when it will fully illuminate the world... I want everyone to know the beauty of this world, and I want everyone to know that there is a loved one. Happiness."
 Neptune_TouchDialog_1:0 "Except for General Richelieu, the French here are really casual, but this is not feasible in front of me..."
 Neptune_TouchDialog_2:0 "Is it time for swordsmanship practice?... Senior Duke of York, please advise."
 Neptune_TouchDialog_3:0 "Senior Belfast, are there any shortcomings in my simulated combat just now?...Senior Sirius, you are also here, that's great, I will record it carefully and try to correct it."
 Neptune_TouchDialog_4:0 "Is it my mission to sail to the ocean on the horizon? Or is everything I have experienced is a calculated trajectory... Commander, is my arrival also in your prediction?"
 Neptune_TouchDialog_5:0 "Humans are always looking forward to space, so what will life in space see?"
  Neptune_TouchDialog_6:0 "The exploration of the predecessors made me what I am today. It’s not wrong to say that I borrowed the light of the predecessors...because this is the destiny that I have been given--because I stand on the shoulders of giants, so I can see the farther view."
 Neptune_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Is today's schedule set? Let's see when we can get together."
 Neptune_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "De Grasse...have you done enough...how come you play tricks as soon as you get beaten...and no matter how much you cry, I won't help you up...what a man..."
 Neptune_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Why come again... Commander, can you not put me and De Grasse in the same group next time... It was not a fair duel that I said before, and I would beg to lose... When you win, I didn't pull you to cry. !"
 Neptune_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Will the girl be under too much psychological pressure... After all, she has no seniors to consult, and she trains alone by herself... Forget it, let's teach her the knowledge learned from her seniors... Commander, I'll go out for a while, and I'll be back soon."
 Neptune_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It turns out that she is also a reliable person, but she prefers to act like a baby... It's really unpredictable... Hey, Commander, I'm in a good mood tonight. Let's have roast beef together. Let me treat you!"
 Neptune_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "You can never forget the glory of the predecessors at any time... Belfast will tell me this every day. I always feel that every time she says this, her voice is a little choked... Is it my illusion?"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_1:0 "The god is with us. If you can detect its existence and borrow its power, there is nothing that can't be done. Well... if I can too"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_2:0 "The repair work of the hilltop shrine is not over yet... I really want to help them, but I'm clumsy. If it doesn't help... Also, let's ask!"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_3:0 "I envy Ise-senpai and others... When will I hear the voice of Shinatobi Ancient God? Double the daily meditation time...?"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_4:0 "Qiuyue and the others seem to regard me as an onmyoji, and they also asked me if I could summon a shikigami...I can't say it-this spell is only used to measure the direction of the wind..."
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_5:0 "In the morning, Shimakaze borrowed a torpedo from me, and it hasn’t come to pay it yet. She won’t be in trouble anymore? After all, it’s still in the experimental stage..."
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_6:0 "May you sleep peacefully amidst the blessings of the ancient gods of Chinatobi-the comfortable wind will bring you the morning light and start a new day."
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I was stared at by a big sister for a long time, she seemed to want to say hello to me, but I don't know why she couldn't say a word, her face was getting worse... she wouldn't be sick, right? ?"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Admiral, good morning. Hey? Bought me the book-"A spell drawing that beginners can easily master"! Thank you very much! Please forgive me for my failure, I am going to the library now! "
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The materials should not be sloppy, otherwise it will damage the circuit of the technique... This, this way! It seems to understand, but it seems to understand nothing! Miss "Elizabeth"-are there any bull's tears here?"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Admiral...Where did you buy this book? This is a lie without permission to publish at all. You and I may not be the first victims, but you must stop others I was deceived by that profiteer!"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "In the first month, she gave me a can of paper cranes, and I want to do something for her. She likes chubby things, so make some chubby sunny dolls? Well! She will like it. of!"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Wow~ the admiral, look! Senior Kaga gave me a lot of talisman paper, saying that these can improve the sensitivity to the spirit, and in the end, you can hear the voice of Shina more than the ancient gods! You! Want to be together? Maybe you can find your guardian spirit~"
 LeonardoDaVinci_TouchDialog_1:0 "I heard that you have always been the leader here...Well, you are very suitable, so that I can have less trouble."
 LeonardoDaVinci_TouchDialog_2:0 "I admire the oriental ninjas...this outfit is the same...actually I can do ninjutsu! But it's just for self-defense, don't worry."
 LeonardoDaVinci_TouchDialog_3:0 "When I was a recruit, I was reckless and didn't do anything well... Now, I will forgive those newcomers for their mistakes. After all, if I make a mistake, it may be dead."
 LeonardoDaVinci_TouchDialog_4:0 "Those who have not experienced real war are not worthy of praise and condemnation of all this."
 LeonardoDaVinci_TouchDialog_5:0 "To calculate the possible situations within three steps, it seems that I am not qualified..."
 LeonardoDaVinci_TouchDialog_6:0 "Speed, invisibility, precision... all of them are indispensable."
 LeonardoDaVinci_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "It's time to eat, what do you want to eat today?... It is forbidden to perfuse, this is my happiest thing every day."
 LeonardoDaVinci_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The place to go today is here...ah, I heard that there are beautiful coral reefs nearby, so let's take a look when the mission is over!"
 LeonardoDaVinci_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Are you still bragging about your previous record?...When will the group of children grow up..."
 LeonardoDaVinci_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "After each battle, you can swim freely in the sea and see a lot of beautiful scenery... Hey, I will pay attention next time, I won't be back so late again!"
 LeonardoDaVinci_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Sir, this is the snack I saved to buy... It's expensive! Come on, divide you in half... how about it? Is it delicious?"
  LeonardoDaVinci_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It's really exhausting to be tight for a long time...Huh? This smell is...Where, where does the smell come from! Too, too foul..."
 Hancock_TouchDialog_1:0 "If there is a typhoon nearby, no matter how urgent the task is, I will block your expedition order."
 Hancock_TouchDialog_2:0 "War is the enemy, and peace is the friend. This is my principle."
 Hancock_TouchDialog_3:0 "The difference between exercises and actual combat is as surprising as the difference between what people say in the manifesto and what people do."
 Hancock_TouchDialog_4:0 "Do you want to read a book?...I don't know how long I have read this book, but I still can't fully understand the meaning."
 Hancock_TouchDialog_5:0 "Time will pass, people will forget many things, so do you, and so do I."
 Hancock_TouchDialog_6:0 "Bell...Essex, don't you think it is too noisy?"
 Hancock_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "This is my favorite breakfast...I have made improvements based on the content of the book. If you don't like it...please discard it."
 Hancock_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Am I weird? Staring at me like that...Also, I don't like others touching my head...Also, you are not someone else."
 Hancock_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The blue ghost...the code name is just that, why bother about other people's names so much."
 Hancock_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Quiet night, best for reading, you too... we can read a book together."
 Hancock_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I have experienced the most rigorous training and made a lot of credit, but that deception made me forgotten... Since then, I have been alone."
 Hancock_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Code...Name... Actually I had another name, but since I was called Hancock, I forgot... Maybe it has become someone else's name, so I don't think so much."
 SanJacinto_TouchDialog_1:0 "The perfect flagship, of course it is Miss CV-16. When you really understand her, you will understand that I am not lying."
 SanJacinto_TouchDialog_2:0 "I still like my previous name-"revenge". But in order to repay everyone who has been supporting me in the rear, a small sacrifice is inevitable."
 SanJacinto_TouchDialog_3:0 "Silly bug, you landed in the wrong place. Let me see your number-oh, it's that guy's carrier-based plane, then wait for her to take you back. Take a break in the hangar first. Can?"
 SanJacinto_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hey, these pesky mosquitoes want to touch me in a delusion? Let me use a machine gun to kill you all-or use insecticide."
 SanJacinto_TouchDialog_5:0 "Commander, I want to hang a swing in the dormitory-hey? Do you need a reason? Then... Flight simulation?"
 SanJacinto_TouchDialog_6:0 "The night in the port area is really terrifying... from time to time there will be cats and birds rushing out... let's lighten up the atmosphere, it's no different from a horror film set..."
 SanJacinto_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Good morning, Commander. I have a suggestion: how about going to the deserted island to survive? As the leader of the port area, you should not be afraid of any challenges, right."
 SanJacinto_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Good morning, Commander, this is the second greeting today. As you can see, we are now on a deserted island, so we have to consider how to survive."
 SanJacinto_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Commander, if you don't perform well, you may be stuck on this island for the rest of your life. However, with me by your side-don't worry about that much, right?"
 SanJacinto_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It's great, to be able to sit together and watch the stars like this, only you and me-very romantic, and I don't want you to leave. The sentence just now is a joke, please don't take it seriously."
 SanJacinto_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "At this point... a campfire should be prepared to keep warm while dispelling some beasts. Huh? There must be unknown creatures on the desert island. Isn't this common sense in literature?"
 SanJacinto_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Commander, it's time to rest. Don't worry, you will find yourself in the office in Minato City when you wake up. Today, it belongs to the secret between us"
 EdgarQuinet_TouchDialog_1:0 "Goben really hasn't changed at all, he is such a big man, he still looks like a child..."
 EdgarQuinet_TouchDialog_2:0 "Every day I have to work harder than the day before. This is my motivation to record all this."
 EdgarQuinet_TouchDialog_3:0 "Really, how come the British always have those whimsical ideas on ships, don't they feel unreasonable for many things?"
 EdgarQuinet_TouchDialog_4:0 "It seems that you did a little bit less today? One must not be lazy."
 EdgarQuinet_TouchDialog_5:0 "Everything is predicated and not predicated. You don't need to ask me how to know this sentence. The time I need to learn a country’s culture is far less than you think."
 EdgarQuinet_TouchDialog_6:0 "Just as armored cruisers are only a short-lived in the world, the British battlecruisers are also destined to follow this fate-they are just covering up the flaws of their design, and they can only seek a breakthrough by overthrowing."
 EdgarQuinet_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "After my observation, you have rarely eaten vegetables in the past week. Therefore, in order to have a balanced nutrition, the meals for the next week will be mainly vegetables. Please be prepared."
 EdgarQuinet_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "You rarely go to the training ground recently. This is not a good signal. I will accompany you and go together."
 EdgarQuinet_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "What do you like? ...I don't want to touch your minefield when I want to give you birthday or anniversary gifts in the future, so it is better to ask in advance and record it."
 EdgarQuinet_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Are you going to sleep? Please wait for ten minutes, I need to review what I did today, so that it is not a waste of time."
 EdgarQuinet_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The starry sky at night is indeed beautiful, but none of this can be recorded. It is a pity that even photos cannot restore their beauty."
 EdgarQuinet_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Will I be strict with you?... If you are unhappy, you must say it so that our relationship can last longer."
 Kiso_TouchDialog_1:0 "Equipment is only used to assist one's own props, it is not good to rely on them too much. Me? I trust my fists more. Fancy moves will only add to the laughter, the real strong only needs a punch -knock off."
 Kiso_TouchDialog_2:0 "Floating reconnaissance aircraft, that thing is very in the way. It's easy to throw it out when you punch it, right? It's too troublesome to collect it afterwards, can you apply for this thing to be removed?"
 Kiso_TouchDialog_3:0 "Oh, are you distressed that there is no movie to watch? I recommend the sword halberd film-it depicts the real battle, which is very bloody. If you have something to practice after watching it Thoughts, I will accompany you at any time."
 Kiso_TouchDialog_4:0 "The eldest sister has excellent grades but was not able to be assigned to the port in time. It is strange to think about it. On the contrary, the lazy guy in the north was given priority for admission. It would not be shady..."
 Kiso_TouchDialog_5:0 "The guys in the United States are pretty good. Both their character and strength are worthy of appreciation. Especially those knights, they are very interesting-in all respects."
 Kiso_TouchDialog_6:0 "You only let Tianlong run the logistics. It was a waste of her swordsmanship. Don't you know? She is the heir to that famous genre! What a pity, I really want to compare her with her."
 Kiso_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Tenryu, are you resting today? Good! Without further ado, let me go to the drill field and try it. I want to see how powerful the legendary swordsmanship is!"
 Kiso_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Admiral, very interesting things will happen in the exercise field later, do you want to come and observe? Think about it before making a decision. You might become a witness to the legend!"
 Kiso_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Changed to new equipment, go north. But it looks like your habit of throwing torpedoes hasn't changed yet. Oi will pay for the maintenance cost for you again. Ha, I seem to be right."
 Kiso_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Her swordsmanship...makes me willing to go down. Probably because of my empty hands, she did not use all her strength, which is regrettable. Should I also try to use weapons-stick, spear, or chain sickle? ?"
 Kiso_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Doctor! Do you have any powerful weapons? Wow, this one is not badso expensive!? No wonder someone calls you "black business" behind your back..."
 Kiso_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Admiral, is there any way to make money quickly? I can do everything for money-eh? Maid? Housekeeping? What do you mean? I understand every word you say, but it's unclear when you connect it together."
 Split_TouchDialog_1:0 "I'm very comfortable with all kinds of equipment. I can use whatever I have. Uh... Changchun, I don't know how to equip you. Can you teach me?"
 Split_TouchDialog_2:0 "Dr. Yubari, we can be considered as colleagues, you build things, I will blow things up. Okay, okay, just kidding, please don't care."
 Split_TouchDialog_3:0 "Prepare to ask the French comrades for advice on how to make the speed faster..."
 Split_TouchDialog_4:0 "Be vigilant at night, because cunning owls can disguise."
 Split_TouchDialog_5:0 "Don't be nervous, comrade, it's me, how about? I pretend to have good skills."
 Split_TouchDialog_6:0 "I will play the accordion when something is in my mind..."
 Split_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The equipment is a bit outdated? Honey, are you sure? Would you like to try it yourself?"
 Split_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The port area is full of my intelligence network, my dear, if you secretly watch others, I will punish you."
 Split_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Don't pinch my stomach, I slowed down because of the change of equipment, not because of food."
 Split_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Yes, I am very good at disguising as various characters, eh? Disguising as this? Yes, but what should I do?"
 Split_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "(Boom!) It seems like a mess, cooking is much harder than I thought. I'm sorry I wasted materials, please punish me."
 Split_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "My dear is sleepy just so early? I've been in a deep sleep for a long time before, so I have good energy."
 Columbia_TouchDialog_1:0 "I hope my name can protect this port area, just like the city it once protected."
 Columbia_TouchDialog_2:0 "When the four of us get together, we are invincible. One's ability is limited, so we will not make such a stupid decision."
  Columbia_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey hey... My injury is no big deal... Oh, I can still smile and it means it's okay, don't dawdle, go ahead! Don't be caught up by my injured junior!"
 Columbia_TouchDialog_4:0 "Senior West Virginia, I can understand your determination to revenge. I hate enemies as much as you. Therefore, I want to find a perfect time to defeat them. Otherwise, it will not be considered a successful revenge. For this, please trust me !"
 Columbia_TouchDialog_5:0 "Montpellier, don't say this in front of Denver next time... The little girl is in puberty, in case you are fascinated by you casually... Cleveland blames me for not helping you. ."
 Columbia_TouchDialog_6:0 "If you are injured, keep smiling... Teacher Triton said this is the best way to reassure your teammates. The most inconvenient thing on the battlefield is to drag your teammates down."
 Columbia_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Good morning! I slept soundly, would you like a sandwich?... I bought it from the supermarket downstairs. Doesn’t it taste okay? Another egg?"
 Columbia_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Denver, you girl is going to try again with me, okay, then I'm not welcome... Commander, help me with my coat... lovely sister, let me teach you what a knight should be in modern times Kind of!"
 Columbia_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The knight is becoming strong because he has someone he wants to protect, Denver...she is very strong now...then I won't lose to her...haha, of course it's because I have you."
 Columbia_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "My dress is too casual?...Please, it's been so long, but you are still stuck in one person's dress. I think Commander, you also need to go back to school for another two years of modern education, otherwise you will become an antique NS!"
 Columbia_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Teacher Triton is the most important mentor in my life. She has taught me a lot...When the war is over, let's go see her together. She must have never thought that the little guy now has a partner... Hehe! "
 Columbia_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Oh? Me, I'm reading the book my elder sister usually reads...well...obscure, not suitable for me...but I think this is meaningful. Because it lets us know the greatness of our predecessors, we can be proud Said he was standing on the shoulders of giants."
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_1:0 "The sword in my hand is to defend the people, and this gun is the guillotine of evil men."
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_2:0 "Give a girl a rose, give a child a book, the rose symbolizes romance, and the book symbolizes the light that leads people forward. No matter which one is lost, the world will be bleak."
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_3:0 "This contaminated life was obtained by chance when I met you. Although it looks scary, I tried to purify it with the power of the Holy Spear. I don't know how long it will take to succeed... "
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_4:0 "Now the angels are all beautified by the world according to their own preferences. If you have seen a real angel with a faded halo, I am afraid you will be scared to cry. (chuckles) I will really be scared, I I didn't lie to you."
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_5:0 "Angels and Satan are just a matter of thought. There is a record in the Book of Job: God’s children are angels, and Satan is among them. Then, Commander, do you prefer to be an angel or a demon?"
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_6:0 "Even a good person like George V will not be able to put down because of his status as an emperor. In fact, we are all the same, there is no high or low, so... Please use the most ordinary tone with me. Just talk."
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Rodney, Nelson, please help me with artillery support. Hood, please cut into the enemy's position and cause chaos with prestige and incomparable speed. As for the rear...George V, give it to your sisters There should be no problem, right?"
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Actually...Compared to being a saint, I hope you all remember that I am a heroic general...Of course, I know that in your heart I am just an ordinary person loved by you, right?"
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Huh-although I have encountered a lot of twists and turns, I finally made this apple pie. Even slaying the dragon didn't feel so tired... I wonder if the commander would like it?"
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Oh-I can finally relax, every day holding a sword in one hand and a gun in the other is really dying... Come and rub it for me... I can't lift my arms..."
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, let's see if this contaminated life has a bit less deep-sea weird aura than it looked like yesterday... If it can really purify them, it means that everything has a chance to change! "
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Don't deliberately suppress your own selfish desires, as long as you don't invade others, satisfying your own selfish desires is a very common thing. So, let's say, what do you want?"
 Indiana_TouchDialog_1:0 "While you are young, sweat and release your energy to your heart's content. Is there anything more comfortable and invigorating than this?"
 Indiana_TouchDialog_2:0 "Although they are not rich in combat experience, my sisters are very good, and I will not be worse than them, right?"
 Indiana_TouchDialog_3:0 "A passionate and energetic life is youth! This healthy skin tone is the proof of youth!... You asked me what my original skin color was like? This question is bold, and I like it."
 Indiana_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's still a bit cold at night. Don't catch a cold. Of course, I'm not afraid."
 Indiana_TouchDialog_5:0 "Washington must be very angry secretly, I let him lose a legendary record, hehe...for this, my waist will still aching..."
 Indiana_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sister, say anything, don't always hold it in your heart. Look at Massachusetts. Although she can't be as easy as I am, but at least she is not a dull gourd."
 Indiana_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "You're awake! I don't think I can wake you up, so I took you out... There is still 1 kilometer from your bedroom. If you don't want to catch a cold, just run and go back to get dressed!"
 Indiana_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Wow, this is not a senior in Washington, you seem to be in good spirits today, but don't walk and read, or you will hit someone and you will hurt yourself!"
 Indiana_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hey!...Come here, hurry up... I'm sweating. Please help me wipe it with a towel."
 Indiana_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Come, lie next to me!...When I am bored, I will lie on this lawn and look at the night sky...Occasionally, I need to calm my heart, right?"
 Indiana_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Look, there are always many interesting things in this port area at night. For example, there are often duels on the trail on the left, and the square on the right is the destroyer's favorite playground."
 Indiana_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huhit seems to be late, and there are fewer and fewer people. Then, come and kiss me."
 Cumberland_TouchDialog_1:0 "Have you ever seen a fish with a lion head? It's great, I want to see it with my own eyes. It was a pity that I didn't have this when I passed by there."
 Cumberland_TouchDialog_2:0 "Is this dress too conspicuous? Ah, that's because I used to be an actor, and this habit can't be changed. The mission of an actor is to present the best self to the audience. Right~"
 Cumberland_TouchDialog_3:0 "Sister Kent! You are here too! Great, I, I thought I would be so lonely that no one knew... That would be better~"
 Cumberland_TouchDialog_4:0 "Due to the carrier-based aircraft, the defense has dropped again... But there is also a good thing. These children are very flexible and can take more angles with the camera. Yes, I am complimenting you, dear boys~"
 Cumberland_TouchDialog_5:0 "Ball, I want to hug you too, but this suit is expensive, and you like to stretch out your paws. Sorry! I will buy canned food to compensate you!"
 Cumberland_TouchDialog_6:0 "These are the oil paintings I brought, how about? Ah! I am so happy that you can understand this beauty! Yes! This work is meant to express"
 Cumberland_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Commander~Would you like to see me and Miss Des Moines' stage play? "Big Search and Rescue! The estuary is perilous?!"-The performance is three days later, so please be there~"
 Cumberland_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hey...Miss Spey, can you please come and make a cameo? After all, it is difficult for others to perform your charm. Don't worry! There will never be any scenes that belittle you! The screenwriter is Exeter Hey hey?! Don't go away"
 Cumberland_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sister Kent, your play is very simple. Just lie down in the port and stay still. But if you don’t move, the expression on your face can’t change less. This is a reminder I wrote to you. There are a total of One hundred and fifty-two pages-Huh? What about people?"
 Cumberland_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Miss Des Moines, are you free? While there is still time, let's make the right show. Well, prepare for the best performance during the performance!"
 Cumberland_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, how was my performance just now? Hmm... Isn't the scene of the mentality change good enough? Thank you! You watched so carefully~ I love you!"

 DucadAosta_TouchDialog_1:0 "Yo~ Sister Zhu Sangnuo, you are here too. Looking at your smug look, you should have cheated a lot of money from this bully. You...just enough."
 DucadAosta_TouchDialog_2:0 "Does Zhu Sannuo particularly like you, full of beautiful words for you? ... She can't believe a single syllable in her mouth."
 DucadAosta_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey, big sister, do you want to make a bet with me? If you win this exercise, I won't grab this business with you. If you lose, you will have to allocate your income here. Decided, how?"
 DucadAosta_TouchDialog_4:0 "To be honest, although Zhu Sannuo is my predecessor, she can say anything to make money... You are so smart, you will not choose her, you will choose me, right?"
 DucadAosta_TouchDialog_5:0 "Huh? Earl Spey, are you going to have a drink?...Cut, I haven't been afraid of anyone when it comes to drinking."
 DucadAosta_TouchDialog_6:0 "Hey, big sister, you can retire with me...really, let me earn this commission this time!"
 DucadAosta_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Do you have the habit of accounting books?...If not, start from today. Here is the income, here is the expenditure, note the reason...Well, I will check it every day."
 DucadAosta_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Cut, Jussano, from today, you must be more than one meter away from the chief, no, three meters!"
 DucadAosta_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I said, you have a lot of regulations in the port area. This morning I wanted to catch a fish and roast it, but I didn't expect to be beaten and scolded by a white-haired girl... Isn't this port area good for fishing? ?"
 DucadAosta_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Hey, the mercenary career is over and I am not used to it, so let's eat and drink together, have fun, and travel the world together!"
 DucadAosta_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Sister Zhu Sangnuo should also rest. For the sake of our little sisters, she desperately earns commissions...When can she take a break..."
 DucadAosta_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Okay, I'm all done with work. Take a break, do you have any romantic thoughts? Speak up and listen."

 FaadiBruno_TouchDialog_3:0 "The younger generations are so good, my senior is just paddling..."
 FaadiBruno_TouchDialog_4:0 "Veneto and I are guns of the same caliber, so I'm at the same level as her. But the seniors should be courteous to the younger generations, so that the younger generations have more opportunities to gain merit."
 FaadiBruno_TouchDialog_5:0 "Good night, baby is going to rest at this time~ So, good night~"
 FaadiBruno_TouchDialog_6:0 "Hey? Why is there such an anti-human thing like running training... Please take back what you said, I don't like it."
 FaadiBruno_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Aren't you going to rest?... I think about it, do you want hot water? I'll cook a pot for you, and then I go to sleep."
 FaadiBruno_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I didn't need training when I promised it? I can't go far if I promised it? What about your promise?"
 FaadiBruno_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Well-if you still want me to be beautiful, and you want me to be so cute, let me rest forever!"
 FaadiBruno_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Walk carefully, our heads hit each other, but you are the one who is unlucky~!"
 FaadiBruno_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "If I really need to be on the battlefield... then it means that the battle is irreversible, and it's a bit sad to say..."
 FaadiBruno_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "When you finish your work, accompany me on the race walk! I won't lose to you this time!"
 S113_TouchDialog_1:0 "The caliber of this weapon is too big for destroyers? There are not a few destroyers equipped with 150mm naval guns in your port area. You don't need to make such embarrassing excuses to chat with me, just speak directly."
 S113_TouchDialog_2:0 "I have a younger sister. She is relatively naive and always fantasizes about beautiful things. Then...well, she went on a trip alone. But there is no need to worry, if she is in danger, I can rush over immediately Method? It's a secret."
 S113_TouchDialog_3:0 "The younger generation should be in awe of the senior, don't do anything to the senior... If you continue to poke my face, I will throw you into the trench... HanS! Do you want to be smashed to the head by a ship anchor so-"
 S113_TouchDialog_4:0 "Are those French destroyers in front of them? There are horns on their heads, which are really a weird combination. However, from them, I seem to feel a familiar breath...interesting, follow up and see Bar."
 S113_TouchDialog_5:0 "...Why does someone have such wings? Is it a bat monster? There are so many wonderful people and things in this port area, which really opened my eyes. After the camera is repaired, I will fix these. Record them all. I have a hunch that I will be able to develop good photos."
 S113_TouchDialog_6:0 "Looking at the expression you want to talk and stop, can you find a good reason to start a conversation? Didn't I say it, just start a conversation normally. Well, but don't say "The moon is so beautiful tonight "This kind of embarrassing opening remark-oh? I guessed it?"
 S113_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Doctor, what are you studying... Space transfer, do you need to use these cumbersome instruments? For me, I just need to wave-no, nothing. The sentence just now is a line in Teshe, don't care. ."

 S113_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Destroy everything, then rebuild everything-this is the easiest way to save the world. But it doesn't work here, so I'm just talking nonsense, you don't need to care... Here we are, the roller coaster here It’s not a gentle type"
 S113_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Are you awake? The feeling of unloading the burden of being with the person you like is better than sighing at a pile of documents in the office~ Is it? After going back, there are still documents waiting for you. However. Don't be discouraged, I will make coffee for you, so keep up your mind~"
 S113_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "When two people are happy, it's called "dating". If I force myself to be with me, I won't be happy...Next time, let's go to play tennis. My skills may surprise you~ "
 S113_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The salary you gave to Leipzig is not bad. But you have to remember, that guy will not be satisfied with this. What she really wants to do is to be a treasure hunter."
 U2365_TouchDialog_1:0 "Mom said that people on land are very bad...but it doesn't seem to be the case. Why should parents lie to their children?"
 U2365_TouchDialog_2:0 "I don't know how the Li'an friends are now...sometimes I miss them very much..."
 U2365_TouchDialog_3:0 "Torpedo...what is that? It can explode if shot out...It's amazing...If it's only like this...Li Anxi can do it too!"
 U2365_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's time to go to bed, and there are people on the training ground... Well, that little girl with a ghost all over her body is very cute, I don't know if I can be friends with her."
 U2365_TouchDialog_5:0 "It's really a magical place. Li Ann Xi is a ichthyosaur so he has these little friends, and the humans in this place also have strange things... I don't know who is better than Li Ann Xi's?"
 U2365_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sneak into the cafeteria in the middle of the night... Hehe, Li Ann Xi is so smart... Hey? How come there are so many people in the cafeteria? Are you all here to steal food?!"
 U2365_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Why... Didn't you fall asleep all night?... Don't worry, she won't bite you, because... Li Anxi doesn't eat people she likes!"
 U2365_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Li Anxi met two stupid trainers. They gave me everything I ate, and I gave them the toys from my childhood, and they left happily... well, they He is a good person."
 U2365_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Um... only this thing for breakfast is not enough to eat... Give Li Anxi more!"
 U2365_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "This... is Li Anxi's home. Because you are there."

 U2365_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "There is less and less stuff in the kitchen recently...that little blue-haired girl...does she also have a good appetite?"
 HaiChi_TouchDialog_1:0 "Everyone in this port area is really gentle... Even so, even the gentler people will get angry."
 HaiChi_TouchDialog_2:0 "The old-fashioned generation is not worthy to live in the world. Even if they follow a century-old tradition, they will be cut. The history of China has several thousand years, and the history of mankind has tens of thousands of years. Nothing can't be changed."
 HaiChi_TouchDialog_3:0 "I hope there is no so-called faction dispute in this port area..."
 HaiChi_TouchDialog_4:0 ""Those who look around from all countries know that I am definitely not Wu Ruo insignificant to the warship..." But I am not an object, but a person of flesh and blood."
 HaiChi_TouchDialog_5:0 "Military education should educate everyone with the fighting spirit, and when they come out, they should look like a soldier, the spirit of a soldier, don't you?"
 HaiChi_TouchDialog_6:0 "Yatxian has leadership abilities that I can't match. Even if I am a senior, I have to admit that I am inadequate...Of course, this does not mean that I think her actions are correct."
 HaiChi_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Feihong...Oh, yes, her name is Ai Li now, and she gave me a Persian cat when she was a child. I like it very much. I don't know if she remembers it."
 HaiChi_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Zhaohe, Ying Rui... During my absence, it seems that you have changed a lot... That girl named Changchun seems to be amazing?... Will there be more amazing companions? ?"
 HaiChi_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "We don't think about the decisive way of fighting anymore. Thanks to you, Admiral. As a reward, I will be with you for life and death."
 HaiChi_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "In this land, there have been countless incidents of fratricide among our compatriots. Including me, Ying Rui, Zhaohe, Yixian... It is great that Ai Li has not experienced all of this. It may be impossible for you. Reasons and metaphors."
 HaiChi_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Although my experience is mediocre, but there are countless sad words of blood and tears. It's time to give you this diary. It may be boring for you. I hope you can leave the old ways of the predecessors. , Turning this place into the tomb of heroes useless."
 HaiChi_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The wild goose lost the couple...where is she?"
 NewportNews_TouchDialog_1:0 "Sister, this weapon can obviously automate it, but you have to hold it in your hand...exercise yourself? I'll save it, it's weird..."
 NewportNews_TouchDialog_2:0 "This training method is simply wrong. Obviously these two trainings can be combined. Don't let us repeat the same content twice. You should take "improving efficiency" as your first criterion."
 NewportNews_TouchDialog_3:0 "With our Des Moines-class sisters, there is nothing that cannot be solved with a single shot. If so, please continue to think of ways to upgrade our weapons and equipment."
 NewportNews_TouchDialog_4:0 "Who designed the road? There is not even a street light in the forest trail, it's too dark... wait, little guy... ah-what can I do now, light the forest... I'll go fast !"
 NewportNews_TouchDialog_5:0 "Speaking of which, what will be the treatment of the meritorious ships after the battle is over?... What about those without meritorious deeds?... I think it's better to understand the situation before making plans."
 NewportNews_TouchDialog_6:0 "Alas-for the glory, for the motherland, for everything that is guarded behind you... I hope the future will not be forgotten..."
 NewportNews_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "These fully automatic electronic devices are really great. It's very worry-free to make some simple breakfasts... How come there are people who can't even master such simple things?"
 NewportNews_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "You don't seem to have much work today?...Well, then I will end training early, meaningless training is not worth staying too long."
 NewportNews_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The turret of the main gun needs to be carefully maintained. Do you want to help?... Don't worry, I won't throw the gun on you. Just come over and help wipe some parts."
 NewportNews_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Look at you... is it cold? Hey, kid, did you hear that? The commander said it was cold... how? My weapon ignited this place, is it warmer?"
 NewportNews_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hey...this artificial intelligence is not as easy to use as expected, my salary is deducted until next year because of you...oh, what a damn place...hey! Stop! You can't play here!"
 NewportNews_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Do you think I have tried my best to fight so far? Have I reached the so-called limit?...I don't know myself, just like I don't know if you have reached the limit."
  Rurik_TouchDialog_1:0 "My dear commander, if you want to make the port area safer and prevent the enemy from encroaching, my suggestion is to build a formidable and powerful port area. What do you think?"
 Rurik_TouchDialog_2:0 "I suggest that some education expenditures can be added to the financial expenditure of the Minato District this year, especially for the interest education of cultural knowledge and professional knowledge, which is very important for the vast majority of partners in Minato District."
 Rurik_TouchDialog_3:0 "Don't care about your beauty when fighting, little girls...this is a life-saving battle! Don't be too rude!"
 Rurik_TouchDialog_4:0 "Ah...have you been here for a long time?...it's nothing, I'm reading "The Spirit of the Law". Many points in it are worth thinking about. Are you interested in discussing it with me?"
 Rurik_TouchDialog_5:0 "Oh-a headache, every one of them is a drunkard... Commander, I suggest a prohibition on alcohol in the port area!"
 Rurik_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sukhbaatar...Why are you Mongolian also in this port area... Damn... I will drive you out one day! Don't smile! This time I won't be fooled!"
 Rurik_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Come on, eat, this is a good thing I specially asked a private chef to make... Whether it is applesauce, ketchup or mashed potatoes, it goes well with this pancake~"
 Rurik_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Have you remembered what you read yesterday?... Then I want to ask you, who is the most famous woman among the descendants of the Rurik Dynasty?"
 Rurik_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Novgorod, I didn't expect that you are still working hard to go around in place today... I won't bother you, and wait until you can step out of this safe harbor one day."
 Rurik_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Reading requires not only perseverance and patience, but also a method. How about reading a book every eight days with me, how about a try?"
 Rurik_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I am not interested in the weak, especially the weaker than me... Therefore, you have to keep showing your strong side in order to let me be with you convincingly."
 Rurik_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "You may not believe it... I am a very enlightened person who does not like to use violence to solve problems... Of course, if I don't understand the truth, I can only reluctantly make them feel violence."
 Kutuzov_TouchDialog_1:0 "Comrade General, your tactical literacy needs to be further improved. I have prepared some books. In addition to theoretical study, I will also supervise you in the exercise field."
 Kutuzov_TouchDialog_2:0 "Rocket guided weapon omnipotence theory? This idea is too ideal."
 Kutuzov_TouchDialog_3:0 "Fleet Staff Officer is a very important position. In addition to assisting comrades in command, I will also supervise comrades in the exercise field. Under my sharp left eye, no one can slow down."
 Kutuzov_TouchDialog_4:0 "I like snow very much. As long as you use it properly, General Winter can also be your ally."
 Kutuzov_TouchDialog_5:0 "...Please don't make such a joke (groping), I can't see anything without my glasses."
 Kutuzov_TouchDialog_6:0 "Have you taken a break at this late hour? I am studying how to improve the air defense capability. This new type of air defense gun can be arranged on the bridge like a wreath. What do you think?"
 Kutuzov_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Why do you prepare so much for lunch? Didn't you say that I have more than a dozen sisters."
 Kutuzov_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Don't feel that training will relax a little bit, on the contrary I will ask you more strictly, dear comrade."
 Kutuzov_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It was so gaffe last night... My dear comrade, you are not allowed to speak out, I will seal your mouth (kiss)"
 Kutuzov_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Wow! Don't come out like this to scare me, okay, no, I am not timid. This is a secret (whispered)"
 Kutuzov_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huh?! Didn't you tell me not to take off my glasses? I can't see anything. What are you going to do my dear?"
  Kutuzov_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Sorry, I don’t actually have a lot like my sisters, but it’s okay if you just have a drink... Hey, hahaha, are you blushing? I’m cute, I’m not drunk, just come over or I’ll have to I bombarded you, how come I have a headache."
 CharlesFAdams_TouchDialog_1:0 "It makes up for the lack of firepower and defense, coupled with excellent maneuverability and concealment, this is where our guided missile destroyer is powerful."
 CharlesFAdams_TouchDialog_2:0 "The missile is not only the strongest spear, but also the strongest shield. Only those who use it freely and flexibly can win the battle."
 CharlesFAdams_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey, Changchun, as entrusted by the commander, let me help you adjust the accuracy of the missile... Alas, no wonder the total firing deviation..."
 CharlesFAdams_TouchDialog_4:0 "Every expedition must be prepared for a protracted battle. Only weak troops will pursue quick battles and quick decisions."
 CharlesFAdams_TouchDialog_5:0 "Senior Kiat, did she still not accept the transformation?...Leave it to me, maybe I know why."
 CharlesFAdams_TouchDialog_6:0 "We are afraid of the unknown and stop, because everyone is afraid of becoming a sinner of history, but if everyone is like this, then the world will no longer progress."
 CharlesFAdams_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "What are you going to do today...I usually go to training. After the oath...doesn't I need to train anymore?... But would it be bad?"
 CharlesFAdams_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "It turns out that I still need to train... so it doesn't look different in peace... No, it's not right, I'm a dedicated fighter, how can I have such a lazy thought."
 CharlesFAdams_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Senior Kiat doesn't listen to persuasion at all... Every time I go by, I play tricks on me... a headache..."
 CharlesFAdams_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "There is still work tonight?... Then it seems that I can only stay in the office, so it is no different from before the vow, working day after day... I was worried before."
 CharlesFAdams_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Look at it, this is the battle plan I just came up with... The only flaw is that we don't have enough guided missile ships now. Can we urge the headquarters to come more..."
 CharlesFAdams_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Hey, Commander, tomorrow we still have to be as loving as we are today, and don't let our future become unknown, can we?"
 Amagiri_TouchDialog_1:0 "Sister! Please tell me the secret to becoming stronger! I also want to grow to the level of one-on-one with battleships! It's too boring to always deal with torpedo boats and other boats! And there is-huh? Second sister, why are you staring at me???"
 Amagiri_TouchDialog_2:0 "Hmm...Is it because my attitude is not sincere enough? If you apprehend, I still have to bring a gift. Okay, set the goal to find something that the big sister likes! Let's go!"
 Amagiri_TouchDialog_3:0 "What kind of talents is needed to become the leader of a country? I don't understand it at all! Who knew that the lucky guy at that time would become such a great person in the future. Hmm...I really don’t look good. what."
 Amagiri_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hmph, finally waiting for you to ask this question. That's right, this adult's costume is specially designed! In order to match the appearance of the appearance, of course the costume must be unforgettable at a glance. Then match this bridge hat. How is it! Isn’t it very shocking~"
 Amagiri_TouchDialog_5:0 "I heard that my sister Ming Fanjian was offering a night training course before, but it was a pity that she was ordered to cancel it by the instructor Xin recently-hey? Ah?! I'm going to practice with the Second Water War?! I haven't just been here long! The opponent is still the Second Water War!!! Without such a"
 Amagiri_TouchDialog_6:0 "Although it looks top-heavy, I won't fall on the sea. On the contrary, I can still surf! It's just that I haven't had a chance to perform... It's really disappointing."
 Amagiri_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I don't want it! Only this is not allowed! My uniform is specially made-it hurts! It really hurts, second sister! I'm not saying that the special type II uniform is not good-looking, I just want to Let yourself stand out a little bit...Yes! Help attract firepower! So that the eldest sister can do her best!"
 Amagiri_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I don’t know if there are unicorns here... Well, I like to observe reptiles very much! Admiral, if you are interested, you can also come together~ Just looking at them, it feels that time has stopped, although it is actually already It will be a long time."
 Amagiri_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It feels like the team with only instructors Rang is very leisurely, I really want to go there. But the eldest sister is in the Sanshui battle again... Ah! It's really tangled! What on earth should I do!"
 Amagiri_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Thanks for your ability to cope with these paperwork, if I can't sit still for a moment. Writing so many dense words on these pieces of paper makes me dizzy just by looking at it..."
 Amagiri_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Is it my illusion? Sister Wu always speaks to the air, which is too weird. Or is that person completely invisible?! Oops... This is too handsome! Super cutting-edge technology! I want it too! !"
  Amagiri_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I'm so hungry... Admiral, let's go and eat something. Don't be reserved, your eyes are all light up when you mention it! The delicious supper is calling for us! Hurry up! Let's get boring! Forget the work~ Eating is the most important thing!"
 CharlesAusbrne_TouchDialog_1:0 "Caring too much about others can make you feel uncomfortable. Commander, are you aware of this?"
 CharlesAusbrne_TouchDialog_2:0 "Everyone in the Little Beaver team is outstanding, so I don't need to worry about anything. On the contrary, I am doing my best to help everyone."
 CharlesAusbrne_TouchDialog_3:0 "Don't pursue too high speed, don't chase the enemy in retreat deeply. Always keep these two words in mind, whether it is training or fighting."
 CharlesAusbrne_TouchDialog_4:0 "Thatcher! You are lazy again... huh? You want to deny it? That's okay. Play with me. If you win me, I will treat it as it never happened. How about? Dare?"
 CharlesAusbrne_TouchDialog_5:0 "Don't take everything to yourself...Hoel, you still have your own things to do, but don't train the Commander to be a useless person."
 CharlesAusbrne_TouchDialog_6:0 "Fairy tales are just tricks for children to play, so I won’t believe it... However, this fairy tale is pretty good. I'd better take a look."
 CharlesAusbrne_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "This is my patrol plan. Don't worry, this is the safest plan. If you encounter an enemy... I know what to do better than anyone."
 CharlesAusbrne_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Bicycles are so hard to learn... Hey, Commander, can you ride a bicycle? Can you take me with you?"
 CharlesAusbrne_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Should it be time to get up?...Just stay with me for a while...hehe, nothing, because...I like you"
 CharlesAusbrne_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Let’s come to the game, whoever loses will be responsible for today’s dinner... But after all, you always lose, so this time let you choose the event, how about it? Do you want to try it?"
 CharlesAusbrne_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Brows...my eyebrows? Is there any problem?...Can the eyebrows be eaten? What a strange question!"
 CharlesAusbrne_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Well done well... hee hee, don't be complacent because you do a little housework well~ you are the commander, you can't be so conceited, understand?"
 Taylor_TouchDialog_1:0 "The weather is good, go out for a wave! By the way, see if anyone has fallen into the water!"
 Taylor_TouchDialog_2:0 "Everyone, please train carefully, Taylor will be watching you all!...If you fall into the water, please send a distress signal, I will be there as soon as possible!"
 Taylor_TouchDialog_3:0 "Obannon, when will we take another trip across the Pacific Ocean? I miss that time!"
 Taylor_TouchDialog_4:0 "U1206...a submarine that will fall into the water...this toilet...so it seems worth studying..."
 Taylor_TouchDialog_5:0 "A lot of incredible things happen at night, and the sea is sometimes gentle and cruel."
 Taylor_TouchDialog_6:0 "Take a rest early, there are many people in need of help waiting for me to help tomorrow!"

 Taylor_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Commander, let me teach you how to observe the movement of the sea... This is a basic skill for surviving in the sea, and you can become a lifeguard like me after you learn it."
 Taylor_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Obannon... Is it true that you used potatoes to repel the submarine?... The outside world is rumored like this. I am curious about the truth. Tell me, OK~"

 Blyskawica_TouchDialog_1:0 "When will the cannonball exceed the speed of sound... so that the enemy hears the sound of the cannon, which means it is dead."
 Blyskawica_TouchDialog_2:0 "Miss Prestige's battles always give me a lot of inspiration. I learned a lot of useful combat knowledge from her."
  Blyskawica_TouchDialog_3:0 "The combat strategy is nothing more than proactive attack and defensive counterattack, but there is no doubt that the first player always has the advantage."
 Blyskawica_TouchDialog_4:0 "Dragon Cavalry, why are you walking and dangling... why are you so drunk... Say! Have you been drinking with the group of people from G again!"
 Blyskawica_TouchDialog_5:0 "I really envy so many people in E country... No matter how strong I am, I am just an individual..."
 Blyskawica_TouchDialog_6:0 "No one can stay lucky forever, we are all the same."
 Blyskawica_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I heard that in country C, you can eat dumplings on any festival?...Well, let's try this, the big Polish dumplings with characteristics of my hometown!"

 Blyskawica_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sir, you look so motivated today. Would you like me to give you a massage? It's very comfortable~"
 Blyskawica_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Really, don't always say strange things to me... Sir, how deeply do you misunderstand my country?"
 Blyskawica_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Uh...how can the pork knuckle made by country G be so greasy... there is no way to take it, let me improve it..."

 NewMexico_TouchDialog_2:0 "Huh-sore shoulders, hey, Commander, do you have that kind of equipment here that is light, with strong firepower, and good protection?"
 NewMexico_TouchDialog_3:0 "Sieffer, let me use your anti-aircraft gun, okay? Just one click, one click. I just want to experience the feeling of not being afraid of planes."
 NewMexico_TouchDialog_4:0 "Lafite, what are you doing hiding here?... Hey? That's not it, hehe, don't bother you, but you can't keep doing this and catch up with her? You are also a hero, you can."
 NewMexico_TouchDialog_5:0 "John--Ston--! Did you skip class again?...Can't you be honest?...Alas, he is also a hero, so why are you so unruly?"
 NewMexico_TouchDialog_6:0 "This means that...the latest tactics are...These types of ships are more suitable...Ah, new things are so hard to learn, it's totally contrary to my common sense!"
 NewMexico_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ahh still to get up
 NewMexico_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Let me think about the recipe for this dish... Don't remind me, I can definitely remember it, I can definitely... That's right, ah, ah, ah, I can't remember, give up, and tell me the correct answer. "
 NewMexico_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The exploratory period is over? How about it. My exploratory period for you will not end in ten and a half months. I will study you for ten or twenty years and study you for a lifetime. Want to get confused? It's not that easy. "
 NewMexico_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "There are recruits who have mastered high technology, are not afraid of death, and have strong leadership skills... Well, the old guy is the old guy, you have to admit your life! However, I am still unique in your eyes. Isn't it?"
 NewMexico_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Move your mind quickly and think about it. Washington invited me to her reception. As a senior, I can't lose to this bunch of recruits... ahem, although I only participated in this battle not long ago, I'm still their predecessors, and I can't lose to them!"
 NewMexico_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Hey, come and take a look. These are the notes I have made so hard. Is there anything wrong?... I know that many of my judgments are wrong now. One by one, I understand it more difficultly."
 Stalingrad_TouchDialog_1:0 "Next, we will demonstrate the fleet movement tactics. Kutuzov will be invited to cooperate, and the commander will be invited to observe."

 Stalingrad_TouchDialog_3:0 "The name Stalingrad makes me very proud. It is a great honor to be awarded this name."
 Stalingrad_TouchDialog_4:0 "On this beautiful midsummer night, comrade, do you have nothing to say to me?"
 Stalingrad_TouchDialog_5:0 "I really want to go to the moon or Mars and see what the sunrise looks like in space."
 Stalingrad_TouchDialog_6:0 "We are twin sisters, please don't confuse me with Moscow, otherwise..."
 Stalingrad_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "It seems that Moscow downstairs is looking at this side? Honey, let me give you a hug."
 Stalingrad_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I didn't expect you to like acting like a baby so much..."
 Stalingrad_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I haven't seen you in the morning for a full 3:25 hours during the exercise. It's almost as long as I have gone through several conference battles. Let me give you a hug."
 Stalingrad_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "A salted fish, just a spoonful of chopped onions, and a glass of spirits right away. This is the healthiest delicacy. Come on, open your mouth, ah--"
 Stalingrad_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Are you still busy so late? Are you tired? Come and rest next to me (sit close)."
 Stalingrad_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Have you encountered any problems? Still have something you want to talk to. It doesn't matter, you can tell me (hug)"
 Delhi_TouchDialog_1:0 "Please don't use people's names to play Scrabble. As a leader, should youMadrid? I seem to go...wait! I said no more!"
 Delhi_TouchDialog_2:0 "Ms. Hood, how are you doing? Seeing that you are so healthy, I justisn’t this book written by the people of Country G?! I can’t believe it, why would you look at this kind of thing!"
 Delhi_TouchDialog_3:0 "Is there a firepower problem? I am a specialized air defense type and do not need such strong firepower. Moreover, I have trusted companions. I am relieved to have them."
 Delhi_TouchDialog_4:0 "At night, the taste of pirates becomes richer. I can't take it lightly. I must protect Miss Hood's safety. Damn pirates, let me see how capable you are!"
 Delhi_TouchDialog_5:0 "The United States is a trustworthy ally. The main gun I am equipped with is provided by them. The performance is better than those old stubborn ones who have been holding on... ahem, it's better not to say it."
 Delhi_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, is there a place I can help? I think about it, I can do a lot of things, from clerical work to-your eyes are starting to fade. Isn't it you going to fall asleep? Wow!? immediately?!"
 Delhi_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Miss Hood, today I want toah! Why are you with people from country G?! I understand! What evil conditions must be used by this "cat" to intimidate you! I am not in Delhi Let you continue to succeed!"
 Delhi_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Civil unrest in the country is the most troublesome thing. Those people I have helped certainly don’t want their homeland to be torn apart. So, I admire you very much, Commander. I can let everyone have no barriers. What kind of personality charm is this to live together."
 Delhi_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Commander, I want to make a dress for you. You seem to be free now? Let me measure the size for you. Um... can you awkwardly move? It makes me a little bit too awkward. Uncomfortable..."
 Delhi_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "As a royal warrior, elegance must coexist with strength. If you behave savagely, what is the difference from a monkey who can only wield weapons? Alas... I really hope Danae can get rid of his bad habits as soon as possible... "
 Delhi_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Oh my god, why are there things from country G even here... Commander, have you been confused by the sugar-coated shells of country G... please listen to me, they are definitely not what you think... They can breathe fire!"
 Delhi_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Miss Counterattack, is this coffee for the commander? Leave it to me next, you can rest. Yes, you can rest assured that I will never fail the mission in Delhi!"
 DucadegliAbruzzi_TouchDialog_1:0 "Now the rehearsal begins~Knight, now is the time to rise. Hold the weapon in your hand and shout loudly-victory belongs to us. Well, nice expression~ I like you very much."
 DucadegliAbruzzi_TouchDialog_2:0 "This is not Andrea, you really haven't changed at all. Well, there are still some differences. Now you are full of love. Let me guess, is it the leader? ?"
 DucadegliAbruzzi_TouchDialog_3:0 "As for people, you can't confine yourself to a small circle-leader, about the expedition, I hope you can think about it again. With your strength, you shouldn't stay here for the rest of your life. ."
 DucadegliAbruzzi_TouchDialog_4:0 "...Is this the path you are going to take? I know, I won't continue to pester you until you complete your goal. But, can I join in? "Save the world" This is the most magnificent adventure chapter."
 DucadegliAbruzzi_TouchDialog_5:0 "If I have any regrets, it is that I failed to conquer Mount Chogorisa. I really want to challenge it again~ But, does it still exist now? Um... It’s too much trouble, I give up Thinking about it~"
 DucadegliAbruzzi_TouchDialog_6:0 "Head, do you know what "love" is? Oh, why do you blush suddenly? Could it be that you already have someone you like? It's good to be young~ I also want to taste the taste of love"
 DucadegliAbruzzi_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Want to hear my adventure story? Oh, then you have to be mentally prepared. My adventure story can't be finished in three days and three nights. Let me think about it. Where do I start? ?Arctic--"
 DucadegliAbruzzi_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Fighting is very boring~ but as an adornment of the adventure story, it is a good interlude. I can't admire the way the enemy is bathed in flames, there is no beauty at all~ However, the horrible howl , It's"
 DucadegliAbruzzi_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Knight, I have something to ask you today. I have figured out the location of the treasure, so can I ask you to go there to explore the situation first? Don't worry~ I will pay the remuneration in advance~"
 DucadegliAbruzzi_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "From the beginning of the night, I can feel a very hot line of sight. It seems that someone has been staring at me. Ah~ This feeling of being in a dangerous situation, how many times I will never tire~"
  DucadegliAbruzzi_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I found it~ this lady in the hat, you have been following me sneakily, what do you want to do? Robbery? If that's the case, do it quickly~ Is it your bare hands? Or with arms? Me? Looking forward to it~"
 DucadegliAbruzzi_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "There are so many things that the leader has to deal with~ It's good to leave these things to the next person to do, and the time should be spent on more meaningful things, such as-ah, I almost said it. Really risky~"
 Zevenprovincien_TouchDialog_1:0 "I am a seven-province alliance, but I am not the seven-province alliance you mentioned...do you understand?"
 Zevenprovincien_TouchDialog_2:0 "I used to be an ordinary person who was bored and fights with others every day. As a result, someone told me that I can have interesting fights every day, so I came... Unexpectedly, there are a lot of people here. Can't beat it."
 Zevenprovincien_TouchDialog_3:0 "Training? I don't accept being guided by someone weaker than me. If you want me to be obedient, you have to... Hey, stop playing, I'm wrong, I'm wrong, I'm going to train, can't I go!"
 Zevenprovincien_TouchDialog_4:0 "The few people in Germany are really amazing, no, no, I have to practice myself before I fight them, otherwise it would be no fun to be beaten every day."
 Zevenprovincien_TouchDialog_5:0 "Really, how come you all have fateful opponents... can't you give others a chance?"
 Zevenprovincien_TouchDialog_6:0 "Texas Hold'em? What is this thing, don't think that using this kind of thing will prevent me from fighting with you, Nevada, if I win, you will not be allowed to run in the future?"
 Zevenprovincien_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Get up and get up, even if you are idle, you can't sleep late! Did you hear it?! Did you hear it!!!"
 Zevenprovincien_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "How can I do this stuff...why-I'm not good at technical things, come here, if you want to eat, burgers are the best in the world!"
 Zevenprovincien_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "If you punch like this, you can...drink! Hey? Are you okay?! Why do you go around behind me silently? It's dangerous. Come on, lie down first. I'll call a doctor."
 Zevenprovincien_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "This place should be... This is... I, I am learning poker, because I have never been able to win against Nevada. Only if she wins can she be convinced to fight with me. Okay, don't disturb me, I want to continue learning. It should be..."
 Zevenprovincien_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Come, have a drink with me. If you can't drink, just drink a drink. I don't like to force others. It's just that it's boring to drink alone. It's great to have someone you can talk to."
 Zevenprovincien_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Oh, I wanted to make a contribution, but everyone is too good, a little confused..."
 Bravyy_TouchDialog_1:0 "They are training today, nothing seems to happen... Hey! Miss Blue Ghost! I'm not following you! I don't know you are training either!"
 Bravyy_TouchDialog_2:0 "Oh-why was it discovered again? I obviously hide it well. I also wear a wreath on my head, and I put my body into the sea...Isn't it all sneaking like this in the movie?"
 Bravyy_TouchDialog_3:0 "Huh-I will be found out because they cheated! That's it!"
 Bravyy_TouchDialog_4:0 "Although it is always found, I will not give up tracking you!"
 Bravyy_TouchDialog_5:0 "Comrade, I want to drink, can you look at the telescope for me? Yes, just look at Lexington and the others."
 Bravyy_TouchDialog_6:0 "Fighting?...No, no, this kind of thing is not suitable for me, I just want to quietly engage in surveillance and tracking, and nothing else is discussed."
 Bravyy_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Well-I was accidentally injured by the aircraft carrier ladies during the exercise. The Lexington group looked so friendly, I didn't expect it to be so cruel..."
 Bravyy_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I can always follow the enemy, but I did not promise that I will not be discovered, right? No one stipulates that following others must not be discovered before it is called stalking."
 Bravyy_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "My work is physically exhausting, so, give me some money to buy snacks"
 Bravyy_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Comrade, the trick of lifting the skirt is useless for me, because my skirt has many layers...Please don't do these time-wasting things."
 Bravyy_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "There are many ways to be lazy in monitoring and tracking. For example, when you are sure that the other party is asleep, you can go to bed. As long as you can keep in complete step with the other party, you will wake up together when the other party wakes up. ."
 Bravyy_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Comrade, today I also successfully completed the task -! Of course, the target is you, you didn't find me following you!"
 U35_TouchDialog_1:0 "The battle must follow the rules, and the defeated enemy is also worthy of respect."
 U35_TouchDialog_2:0 "U156 is a lovely child, and very kind. It just lacks some flexibility."
 U35_TouchDialog_3:0 "Bullying the weak...Do you really think so? The war is like this. The strong survive and the weak lose."
 U35_TouchDialog_4:0 "Wolves?...I don't like this name very much. Although it feels very powerful, it is a bit too ruthless."
 U35_TouchDialog_5:0 "Proactively attack at night?...Sorry, unless I have accurate information, I will not do such inefficient things. When everyone in the world knows that I will be active at night, this behavior will appear stupid. ."
 U35_TouchDialog_6:0 "Canned food is the greatest invention in the world."
  U35_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Now is the break time, so don't talk about work anymore, okay?"
 U35_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Sir, I need to remind you not to grab canned fruits with U96, otherwise you may lose more than just cans."
 U35_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I am going to set off, remember to wish me good luck. Good luck always accompanies submarine combat, this is common sense~!"
 U35_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The canned food for the expedition tomorrow, and...Ah! By the way, I made more canned food when I made it, put it in the refrigerator, and take it if you want to eat it. Of course, this is just emergency food, you still have to Eat more regular meals."
 U35_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "U1206, as a submarine, we must be patient and careful, understand? You have the most advanced technology and equipment, and you must make good use of it, don’t be afraid."
 U35_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Finally, I can take a break, huh-is there anything delicious? Except for canned food, I want to eat the fresh dishes you made. Is it okay?"
 Glamorgan_TouchDialog_1:0 "The stern of the ship is flooded...Miss Kitchen God, are you not used to this setting?...Don't bother with such boring things."
 Glamorgan_TouchDialog_2:0 "What about the missile... the little white-haired girl over there, lend me the missile to use it...really, what a broken missile..."
 Glamorgan_TouchDialog_3:0 "Excuse me, if this port area is dissatisfied with the commander's decision, can he rush into the commander's office to oppose it?"
 Glamorgan_TouchDialog_4:0 "Okay, okay, Miss Hood, don’t have to tell me how brave the Royal Navy was back then. I’ve read it all in books...but all that doesn’t exist for me. What I see It's just a mess."
 Glamorgan_TouchDialog_5:0 "Young and old? Do you mean me?...I don't want to, but that's the price of studying history. Knowing too much about history can make people too unsentimental."
 Glamorgan_TouchDialog_6:0 "Military medal? I don't need this kind of thing. For me, victory is the best medal...Nothing. The so-called titles and titles are just temporary."
 Glamorgan_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Okay, it's time to learn. Seeing that you should have nothing to do now, let's study with me."
 Glamorgan_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I really envy the seniors who have so many rich experiences...Avant-garde, you have seen the last glory somehow, haven't you? I envy you, it's too late."
 Glamorgan_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hoo...huh... scared me to death. I had another nightmare. In my dream, I returned to medieval England. At that time, the country was still divided, and I...became an earl..."
 Glamorgan_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Dream? Did you ask me?... I want to be a librarian, that is, I can always read books that record every moment of mankind. I think this kind of life will be very happy."
 Glamorgan_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Can you hug me?...Thank you, so warm, this is not something cold books and sea water can give me..."
 Glamorgan_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "This port area is obviously changing, but it feels like a long time has passed. I can't fully understand the story even after going through the files. Can you tell me something?"
 Implacable_TouchDialog_1:0 "Objective, rational, and neutral moral highlands are but the last weapon of the despicable."
 Implacable_TouchDialog_2:0 "As a commander, are you expecting peace? If it can be resolved peacefully, then there is no need for you to exist."
 Implacable_TouchDialog_3:0 "True peace is impossible. We can only control violence within a controllable range through coercive means. This is the only way to solve the problem."
 Implacable_TouchDialog_4:0 "Are these flowers beautiful? I like them very much, and I hope they never die."
 Implacable_TouchDialog_5:0 "I hate appeasers, and I hate those who say that violence should not be used to solve problems, but I will impose all this on real villains. Although there are mostly stupid people in the world, I have no reason to hurt them. "
 Implacable_TouchDialog_6:0 "Eyes are the windows of the soul. It is true, but there are too many filthy things in the world, and you can't see the way forward with your eyes."
 Implacable_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Miss Guanghui, you are so knowledgeable, you should know better than me what reality is like, so I believe you can understand what I did, right?"
 Implacable_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I believe you, I believe you will guide us on the right path. Um... I mean, I have run out of guide bees, can you take me to Miss Kitchen God?"
 Implacable_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "All this is not the status quo we expect. But I will argue that this is the most reasonable status quo and will not disappoint your trust."
 Implacable_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Eyes? I don’t need to use my eyes to see. Miss Kitchen God has specially designed a guide bee for me, which can guide me forward. The only disadvantage is that the guide bee is disposable and has a short life span. trouble……"
 Implacable_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Of course the saints can retaliate with virtue, complaining that we like violence, and complaining that we have common vengeance. But if they are really on the right side, how can they cause war?"
 Implacable_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Commander?...Are you asleep? Then...I'll just take a look and take a quiet look, as long as I know what the commander looks like...How is this wreath so tight!"
 GeorgesLeygues_TouchDialog_1:0 "I can understand their decision to remain neutral in the war. But war is not a children's play game. When the war spreads to the motherland, it is not so easy to fight back."
  GeorgesLeygues_TouchDialog_2:0 "In principle, our first priority is to protect the safety of Dunkirk and Miss Strasbourg. However, if the general needs our place, please don’t worry, just speak up~"
 GeorgesLeygues_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hello, General Richelieu. Are you here to inspect the training situation? Yes, everyone works hard. They are all fighting hard to fight alongside you. Oh, Loire, Even you think so~"
 GeorgesLeygues_TouchDialog_4:0 "General, there are some documents that you need to look at yourself-you look like a person at work, the one who gave me the name. I believe you will surpass him and become a greater person!"
 GeorgesLeygues_TouchDialog_5:0 "No one wants to see the division of his own country, no one wants to see... a former friend became an enemy in an instant. The world is changing so fast that it is so fast that it is unacceptable, but they have to face..."
 GeorgesLeygues_TouchDialog_6:0 "I didn't expect to meet someone with the same stern! Your weapons and equipment are too exaggerated! You are amazing! Just holding this thing takes a lot of effort! Hey? Let me try ? Then I will"
 GeorgesLeygues_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Once, I also liked to sit in the library and see the knowledge of ancient and modern Chinese and foreign. Now, this kind of time is getting less and less. With me, only you are leftand, at any time. The coming battle."
 GeorgesLeygues_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "When I am with you, I seem to be able to laugh from my heart again. Yes, you have such a magical power. It is because of you that everyone will come here and become this big family A member of it."
 GeorgesLeygues_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I hate coffee. The bitter taste only reminds people of the embarrassing past. Sugar cubes and condensed milk are just a pretense to deceive yourself. Ah, I'm very sorry, I didn't target you... just, Recalling memories..."
 GeorgesLeygues_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "After the oath, I was full of complaints... I hope you don't mind. Hey? You want to hear my past...? This... Where should I start with... At that time, I just served. "
 GeorgesLeygues_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "...I aimed the weapon at a former friend. We who are on the opposite side are so unfamiliar. For the faith that we adhere to, even if we want to "war" with..., it is such an unreasonable existence. "
 GeorgesLeygues_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Perhaps, what awaits me is still cruel fate. But, this time I will not be afraid. I have met you and everyone-until the last minute, I am also a member of the port. "
 Hammann_TouchDialog_1:0 "Rescue depends on technology and patience. No one should be given up."
 Hammann_TouchDialog_2:0 "Miss Yorktown, it's time for the mission. I'm ready, let's go!"
 Hammann_TouchDialog_3:0 "The next stop... North Atlantic? I remember it was cold there. Take precautions against the cold, Commander, can you please inform Miss Kitchen God, every sister’s ship outfit must be well protected from the cold."
 Hammann_TouchDialog_4:0 "Miss Lexington, can I be with you?...Nothing, I just want to talk to you. Would you like a bottle of soda? I just bought it on the way."
 Hammann_TouchDialog_5:0 "Would you like some tea?...It's nothing, Miss Lexington said you like to drink tea with this flavor. Am I correct?"
 Hammann_TouchDialog_6:0 "It's getting late, ready to go to bed...Ah! Atlanta, come with me! Someone fell into the water, like... that submarine!"
 Hammann_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sorry, originally today was a day off, but it turned out... OK, don’t hurry, I’ll be there right away. A team encountered an emergency, I’ll come back to compensate you, wait for me!"
 Hammann_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Miss Yorktown, your eyes...If you have time, come to my workshop with Miss Kitchen God to check again...No, I'm worried!"
 Hammann_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "What do you want to eat?...Don't mention dishes that are too difficult! In Chinese food, I only learned Huaiyang and Cantonese...Don't mention Sichuan food! I can't eat spicy..."
 Hammann_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The sky is dark...What? Ordered to give up? Who ordered it?...Sorry, I didn't have a good tone just now, and I shouldn't be angry with you. I...Please tell the person who ordered that I am lost. Help me lie to them, thank you!"
 Hammann_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huh? Commander, haven't you noticed that the medicine in the medicine cabinet has expired?...Really, what if there is an emergency? I will buy a new one now and come back to teach you."
 Hammann_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Eating too much sugar at night is bad for your skin, but snacks with plenty of sugar can make you happy...how to balance it..."
 Lutjens_TouchDialog_1:0 "Although it is a bit embarrassing to be born in an era when the old and the new are alternated, I am still a member of the G navy and will do my best for the port area."
 Lutjens_TouchDialog_2:0 "The predecessors of Country G have come long ago. There are many predecessors who have only heard of the legend. I really want to ask for an autograph, so I won’t be scolded..."
 Lutjens_TouchDialog_3:0 "Senior Bismarck, ah, this, this is the first time I have seen you in real life. You are more handsome than I thought. Is your previous impression? Miss Tirbitz gave me... "
 Lutjens_TouchDialog_4:0 "Everything here is incredible. It's amazing. It feels like something interesting happens every day."
 Lutjens_TouchDialog_5:0 "Miss Ella taught me a lot of interesting knowledge about the port area, such as not eating dishes made by Miss London, not drinking the food made on a night tour of country J, and...ah, things to remember for a while Too much, not enough brains."
 Lutjens_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sir, am I making progress today? If so, I hope you can praise me... Yes, I will satisfy my vanity a little bit. After all, this is the driving force for me to forge ahead."
 Lutjens_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Breakfast? I can eat canned food, but... can you give me two more slices of bacon?"
 Lutjens_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The seniors were very hardworking and handsome when they were training, ah, that was the Hood of the Royal Navy... hey? Why does it feel like the atmosphere is not right, wait, senior Bismarck, don't get out of touch!"
 Lutjens_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Would you like to go for a walk together? Every day with the seniors, I feel nervous, and it is not bad to go out and relax occasionally."
 Lutjens_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "What the Hindenburg-seniors are doing... eh? That is... Ah! Is this one of the legends of the port area the Hindenburg vs. Missouri they said two days ago? Should I hide... hey? You It's from country S, what's it called?"
 Lutjens_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huh? Did a little guy with red hair and glasses ran over just now? I remember Miss Kitchen God said that if this person is here, what will happen..."
 Lutjens_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The cocktail I tried to make, can you taste it? Is it softer than yesterday's taste, or do you prefer spirits?"
 Barb_TouchDialog_1:0 "Whether it is the navy or the army, they are my assassination targets, all you need to do is issue orders."
 Barb_TouchDialog_2:0 "All the tactics of modern warfare are based on a perfect industrial system. Without a perfect industrial system, it will only be a failure."
 Barb_TouchDialog_3:0 "Never give up on your teammates, unless you see them with your own eyes, you will never be sure of her life or death. But then again, must seeing be believable?"
 Barb_TouchDialog_4:0 "When will I have a chance to record an air force unit on the battle result?"
 Barb_TouchDialog_5:0 "Look at what it is? No, no, it's not an enemy, it's a military exploit that moves or does not move."
 Barb_TouchDialog_6:0 "It's just a small injury, no big deal, I tell you, I was the one who survived the enemy's carpet bombing on the sea!"
 Barb_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The productivity of the port area is still insufficient. If more steel, fuel, aluminum and ammunition can be produced, wouldn't it be..."
 Barb_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The people of Country J pay too much attention to will, tactics, and such things. Without a solid industrial foundation, all this is useless. No matter how good tactics are, barbarians will not defeat civilized society."
 Barb_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Come and help me move something. This is the latest ship repair equipment I got from the doctor. Just click here, click here again, it's fine, isn't it convenient?"
 Barb_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Although the battle between the mackerel and archer is well known in the world, I am better in terms of record."
 Barb_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Don’t always think about the ones you don’t have. Please help me order two more latest technology magazines, at least five years first, right? There are discounts. Only by keeping abreast of technological developments can you be invincible. ."
 Barb_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I am not afraid, but when I am in the environment, no one listens to me and has no time. When I am out of danger, there is no need to be afraid, right?"
 NewJersey_TouchDialog_1:0 "Sister, didn't I come here? Don't be angry. Alright, alright, I know it was wrong to run away from home. It was not because of the discord at the time. Quit your anger, calm your anger~"
 NewJersey_TouchDialog_2:0 "Listen to my advice, those big stars in my family are going to lose face, sometimes don't poke their weakness in public. Otherwise, you will be delicious."
 NewJersey_TouchDialog_3:0 "How about, my training data is not bad, right? Although I came late and did not participate in the system training, but I walked around these years, I am not worse than my sisters in terms of fighting skills."
 NewJersey_TouchDialog_4:0 "What are you looking at? Let me see... Isn't this Wisconsin's service record? Would you like to see mine? It's similar to hers."
 NewJersey_TouchDialog_5:0 "The port area is still a bit boring, so tidy up and get ready...Ah! Big sister! I, I didn't say anything! I didn't want to escape, save, help, sisters, sister killed!"
 NewJersey_TouchDialog_6:0 "If you are also a fighter, you should choose to face us directly. Ah, Commander, when did you come... It's nothing, just talk to yourself."
 NewJersey_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Training training training! It's really annoying, I have to train every day, Commander, can I not train? Let’s get around"
 NewJersey_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Wisconsin, laugh or laugh-don't do it, don't do it, I'm your sister! Do you dare to move me?! Help, help, hahaha, itchy, stop it!"
 NewJersey_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Where do you want to go? I can take you there. But if you say in advance, I won't go to boring places."
 NewJersey_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I haven't been wandering outside these years, but don't listen to their nonsense. I have been looking for that bad guy and want to fight her one-on-one. It is also the purpose of Missouri to be a star. Although our sisters have different personalities, They don’t agree with each other, but the goals are still the same."
 NewJersey_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The white-haired woman named Hindenburg is quite persevering. Although she hasn't won much, she still insists on the challenge. Missouri is also because of this, she will always agree to her challenge."
 NewJersey_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Do you have the kind of opponent you always want to beat? Do you think that sometimes such an opponent, subconsciously, is actually your friend?"
 Salem_TouchDialog_1:0 "It's really boring during the day. People walk on the street, observe etiquette, and abide by the law. But they are thinking of evil things behind their backs, which is really disgusting."
 Salem_TouchDialog_2:0 "My sisters are really brave in fighting, and I want to be so. But I am afraid that I will be suspected again..."
 Salem_TouchDialog_3:0 "They are very happy in the port area, are they smiling, or are they sincere? Commander, can I trust you?"
 Salem_TouchDialog_4:0 "The moon has come out, and you are here too. With your company, I am no longer alone."
 Salem_TouchDialog_5:0 "Can I tell you what I am thinking about? After all, you can't speak or tell me."
 Salem_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, I'm talking to it, and you heard it, then, do you want to join us?"
 Salem_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "My hometown is a very beautiful place, where the birds and flowers are fragrant and the trees are full of shades. If you have the opportunity, go back and have a look with me."
 Salem_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The sun is so big, it's a bit dazzling...hey? These are...sunglasses? It's much more comfortable, thank you, is it okay to hold my hand? It's the first time I'm walking in the sun."
 Salem_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Your name is...Tilbitz? I heard that you don't like to go out during the day, and I...Huh? This is? Play games with you?! Good, okay..."
 Salem_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "People think of me as a symbol of a nightmare, an ominous witch, but because of this, I met you. I wonder if this is the so-called interdependence of good fortune and misfortune?"
 Salem_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I was no longer alone with it. Now I am happy to have you. You and it will definitely become good friends."
 Salem_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "This moon boat is a dessert I made. I didn't know how to make it the first time. If it tastes good, I will make it for you next time."
 Dido_TouchDialog_1:0 "Myths only end in tragedy, why do people still seek to become gods?"
 Dido_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sirius, you have grown a lot and become more confident. It seems that this is a good place."
 Dido_TouchDialog_3:0 "Modern industry is developing so fast, the gods of the past may not be able to control the world. This is the twilight of gods and the hope of man."
 Dido_TouchDialog_4:0 "Don't pray to heaven when you encounter things. The gods in heaven will only sneer at your misery, or treat them as a joke. No god will really care about people."
 Dido_TouchDialog_5:0 "Those people haven't understood my decision so far, nothing, they don't need to understand. How can the gods understand the hearts of mortals?"
 Dido_TouchDialog_6:0 "I once had a wonderful dream. The hazy happiness seems to be within reach, but it lacks real feeling..."
 Dido_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "How gentle you are in peace, how brave you are in war-I used to think that this kind of person can only exist in myths, but I didn't expect you to appear."
 Dido_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Sorrow is forbidden, scruples are forbidden. In front of me, you just need to confess everything about you."
 Dido_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Huh, take a break. After all, this is not the most stressful time. The most important thing is to recharge your energy. Would you like me to make you something delicious?"
  Dido_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I now understand that the hazy happiness in my dreams is you. Only because of you can I feel happiness."
 Dido_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Sirius, meeting here can be regarded as a guide for fate. Neither you nor me can escape the fate of battle. The light of this North Star is really everywhere."
 Dido_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "What would you like to drink? It is better to have a hot drink in the evening...This is what I just learned. You have to thank Miss Hood and Miss Prestige."
 Canberra_TouchDialog_1:0 "The port area is really clean. Unlike the place where I worked before, snakes would crawl in through the window at night, and then-huh? Why is your face a little ugly?"
 Canberra_TouchDialog_2:0 "Ah! It's sister Kent! I thought I would never see you again! Wow, ball! You are still so big, you really don’t look like a tiger. Come meet Kwal, you mustno Stretch out your paws!"
 Canberra_TouchDialog_3:0 "I have a lot of camping equipment on my body. After all, searching for enemies in the previous place was too troublesome, and I ended up spending the night in the wild. So I always carried these with me."
 Canberra_TouchDialog_4:0 "Kvalle, you finally woke up. Here, today’s eucalyptus leaves. Did you know? You almost got eaten by the ball today! But you don’t care, anyway, you’ve been sleeping anyway ."
 Canberra_TouchDialog_5:0 "Huh? What flew over just now? Wow! Many cats. This won't be a zoo... Let me go in and have a look-oh! And the wolf! I have to take it quickly!"
 Canberra_TouchDialog_6:0 "Wow, wow! It scared me to death! Why did this light suddenly turn on! I thought it was a flares... Hey? Distance sensing? And this kind of high technology... I'd better stay away..."
 Canberra_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "When I first went to work there, I was scared enough by spiders, snakes, and other crawlers that couldn't be named. Later I got used to it, and they wouldn't do anything as long as they didn't cross the border. For example, this TarantulaHuh? Commander, where did you go!?"
 Canberra_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Finally found you, Commander. Don't worry, I won't take spiders out again. Cough cough, where did you go? Yes, as long as you are not in the bounds. Also, don't stare at the kangaroo. That means provocation!"
 Canberra_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Peterson, this way! I'm here, hey! Where are you going around! Alas, is that kid avoiding me? I want to give her some maple syrup."
 Canberra_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "You and me are the only ones left, Commander~ Do you want to try to sleep in an outside tent? That way you can see the stars and the moon, it's very romantic~ Hmm! Let's go!"
 Canberra_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "This may be a good time... Ah, I didn't say anything! Look, something flies over there! It's now--Ah! Kvalle! Why did you wake up suddenly?! Please. ,go to sleep now!"
 Canberra_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "As a result, I still didn't kiss... Hey? I didn't say anything! Let's go to bed! Then, that! If you can, can you kiss me on the forehead... ah... ah... ..."
 Garibaldi_TouchDialog_1:0 "Zhu Sangnuo, how much money did you pit the chief for here?...You really are. You are not so much a mercenary, I think you are more like a scammer who uses rhetoric and clever rhetoric."
 Garibaldi_TouchDialog_2:0 "Abruzzi...ah, it turns out that she is here too, so the competition seems fierce, I have to work harder."
 Garibaldi_TouchDialog_3:0 "Although some of us mercenaries feel very unreliable, but they will be successfully completed after receiving the task, please rest assured."
 Garibaldi_TouchDialog_4:0 "Although it’s a bit strange to say that, I hope you can pay attention. The words of praise in Zhu Sannuo's mouth are true or false. Don’t agree to her request just because of her praise, this woman is terrible ."
 Garibaldi_TouchDialog_5:0 "I did a lot of work today, let me see if I made enough money to buy a new dress...Well, what should I buy?"
 Garibaldi_TouchDialog_6:0 "I'm so tired-ready to rest! Sir, you should also rest early, only a good body can do more work and make a lot of money!"
 Garibaldi_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Will you accompany me to see the little skirt today? I have saved the reward for a long time, and I can finally spend it!"
 Garibaldi_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Calla rare vacation, go out to play with me? Hey, rest assured, I will pay."
  Garibaldi_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Jusangnuo, please keep a distance of 5 meters away from the chief at all times, no, 10 meters away! Yes, all tasks you want to take in the future will have to pass through my hands."
 Garibaldi_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Want to hear the story again? Although the life of a mercenary is very colorful, if you tell one every day, you will get bored sooner or later."
 Garibaldi_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Master Pompeii... is that there? Hey? Is that meaty little guy challenging Master Pompeii? Huh-it's overwhelming. Let me see how you will be defeated."
 Garibaldi_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Is there anything else I need to do? For example, like Zhu Sang Nuo, press your shoulders and pound your back?...You really want to eat this set, then I will learn to do it, but , Give me time."
 Kelly_TouchDialog_1:0 "Good morning~ Kelly greets you, Commander, are you ready to go?"
 Kelly_TouchDialog_2:0 "I hate snow, and even the wind. Only a clear sky is suitable for an idol like me!"
 Kelly_TouchDialog_3:0 "Senior, senior, all seniors are very good, Kelly just needs to cheer for everyone."
 Kelly_TouchDialog_4:0 "I lost the precious command power because of injury at the beginning. Next time, I will definitely not let the command power be surrendered!"
 Kelly_TouchDialog_5:0 "Javelin?... Did she come so early? Cut, then this time, I will grab your results."
 Kelly_TouchDialog_6:0 "Magic? How can I release this kind of thing to you casually... I am not a firefly."
 Kelly_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey? Are these things Kelly supposed to do? Isn't it what you do, commander?"
 Kelly_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Look at what Kelly found, a firefly kid who is alone. Kid, what are you doing here alone?...Good, senior--!"
 Kelly_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "So there are so many idols in the port area? The competition is fierce...but I have Mountbatten fans and I will not lose!"
 Kelly_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Kelly is very tired, Kelly doesn't want to be energetic anymore...Ah-let me rest."
 Kelly_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hey, Miss Guanghui's light is really dazzling, too dazzling. It makes me a little bit unable to open my eyes."
 Kelly_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Actually, hehe, I don't know magic at all... Although Miss Guanghui once wanted to teach me, Senior Firefly also said about it, but I'm too lazy...hehe, but with them, I don't know magic. It doesn't matter."
 England_TouchDialog_1:0 "Speaking of the origin of my name, it is another story-you are really a good listener. Would you like to add a cup of coffee? The previous cup has already cooled."
 England_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sit in the breezy garden and have a cup of afternoon tea-this life is not desirable? However, I am still more used to those days on the deck. "Ease" can make people sick what."
 England_TouchDialog_3:0 "The process of hunting a submarine is like hide-and-seek. The submarine is responsible for hiding, and I am responsible for finding them. Then, give them a few hedgehog bullets to blow up the perfect splash. Hum~ the "bad boy" is gone. ."
 England_TouchDialog_4:0 "The most important thing for "fishing" is patience. If you are too impatient, you will expose your own flaws and let the "fish" catch the gap and escapethe same is true for fishing. Huh? Is there any problem?"
 England_TouchDialog_5:0 "Those that have passed away have turned into stars in the sky, and have become a force that supports the advancement of the living. Because of this, we cannot shrink back."
 England_TouchDialog_6:0 "It is not terrible to hit a reef during the mission. The terrible thing is that the shock caused by the deep bomb hitting the target happens to happen at the bottom of the ship... The sudden sense of weightlessness is unacceptable."
 England_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Commander, you should know what I really want. A like-minded partner is far more precious than real money. Of course, you will always be the first, and you don’t need to have a sense of crisis~ "
 England_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Is the Borg over there? It’s really interesting, "fishing" by intimidation. Should I try it too... Well, I can’t think of anything terrible about me, so let’s forget it. ."
  England_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Did you say their names? Yes, I remember them all. After all, they were hard-fished prey. Of course, keep them in mind. If possible, I even want to make a showcase for them."
 England_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Dinner is freshly boiled fish soup. Don't worry, this is a genuine fish. Could it be that I am sick to that extent in your eyes? This is really...something sad. "
 England_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It was acting just now, you don't need to care. I have been sailing on the ship for a long time and there is no entertainment. I learned this skill from other sailors. Sometimes it works well~"
 England_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The work is very hard. I can understand. After all, I feel tired just looking at it. What can I do to relieve your stress? Please speak up, there is nothing wrong between us. ~"
 Proekta47_TouchDialog_1:0 "Tank performance is an organic combination of three elements, and destroyers are no exception. Not only are they high-speed, they also need to be equipped with cruiser-like armor belts to resist enemy fire."
 Proekta47_TouchDialog_2:0 "Although the model code sounds cool, I still a little envious that other sisters have their own names..."
 Proekta47_TouchDialog_3:0 "In the range of shooting, no destroyer is my opponent. Western destroyers only rely on the rate of fire to cover it, which is too wasteful of ammunition."
 Proekta47_TouchDialog_4:0 "Look, look! There is a carrier rocket launched, hurry up and make a wish to the rocket..."
 Proekta47_TouchDialog_5:0 "What wish did I make? Please look into my eyes...it's nothing, I didn't say anything just now."
 Proekta47_TouchDialog_6:0 "Seeing that the gay light is still on, I thought you were still learning, but did you just do this?"
 Proekta47_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Think of it now that the active attack at that time was really bold... (blushing)"
 Proekta47_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "As my partner, I don’t have enough knowledge. There are a few books on algebra and physics. Algebra can study ballistics. Are you interested in astronomy? I can teach you all of these."
 Proekta47_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "My dear, remember not to touch my head in front of other destroyers, I am very authoritative in front of them."
 Proekta47_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I'm afraid of the cold, give me a hug... It's still a bit cold, be more enthusiastic, hug me tightly."
 Proekta47_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Thinking that you can get me drunk and you can get by? Too naive, dear, you want to get drunk with the Red Navy? Today's algebra topic will not only be unavoidable, but it will be doubled. Let's discuss it together (sit side by side) Down)"
 Proekta47_TouchDialog_oathed_6: 0 ".!? I would also like to call ...... call ...... (nonsense) Ow ah sorry I dream bite you one ......"
 LeTerrible_TouchDialog_1:0 "Sister-in-law, I am number one again today. It's a pity, let's compete again next time, call that Tashkent."
 LeTerrible_TouchDialog_2:0 "My performance today is okay? So, this performance will be my passing line tomorrow."
 LeTerrible_TouchDialog_3:0 "How do you feel that the reputation of Utopian Class is not very good, is it my illusion?"
 LeTerrible_TouchDialog_4:0 "I am very comfortable with everything in Minato, thank you for your concern. Also, can I see the flight attendant's record in the past combat? I want to know how far I am from her now."
 LeTerrible_TouchDialog_5:0 "Speed ​​is useful in many situations, but if it's just speed, it doesn't make any sense."
 LeTerrible_TouchDialog_6:0 "General, are you still busy? I want to see what you are doing, I want to know, what else can I learn."
 LeTerrible_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Why do you love falling down so much? What?! This is the tradition of utopian class?! I won't...Ah!"
 LeTerrible_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "General, this must be some weird magic spell! Wait... I see, it must be the shining fireflies, they are best at making fun of magic... Enough! Don't laugh! I'm not kidding!"
 LeTerrible_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Isn't this Strasbourg, I am going out on a mission today? It just so happens that my mission is to protect you."
  LeTerrible_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Every time I deliver a letter, I fall down and get hurt...Oh, although the delivery is very ceremonial, it's okay to call me, wait, don’t you know how to use the phone?"
 LeTerrible_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "General Richelieu, please forgive me for being late. I heard that you wanted the flight attendant to bring me the letter from the team, but I never received it. Could it be..."
 LeTerrible_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "General, please forget all the embarrassing things during the day, yes, don't leave any memories, don't at all!"
 Agincourt_TouchDialog_1:0 "Wandering for too long, I have forgotten the appearance of my hometown."
 Agincourt_TouchDialog_2:0 "A volley will damage the hull? Commander, please do not believe this baseless rumor. I guess it must be a rumor spread by the jealous Prussia."
 Agincourt_TouchDialog_3:0 "The way the porcelain shattered when the volley fired was really pleasing, especially considering how expensive and rare these things are."
 Agincourt_TouchDialog_4:0 ""The largest displacement, the longest lines, the most fierce firepower..." These are the compliments of the Royal Navy Shipbuilding Director to me, but even these compliments are not enough to describe my charm."
 Agincourt_TouchDialog_5:0 "These people from Prussia are really rude, they are really ruining the atmosphere of dinner, don't you think? Prince Savoyeogen."
 Agincourt_TouchDialog_6:0 "The world is developing too fast, and it is easy for people to forget their original beliefs."
 Agincourt_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Would you like something to eat? It is recommended to choose high-calorie foods. No calories are not enough for high-intensity work."
 Agincourt_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Although I'm a little tired, please take my arm, and keep etiquette in the port area."
 Agincourt_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "All furnishings have been optimized according to your habits. Is this cushion comfortable?"
 Agincourt_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Holy object? You would be very wrong to think so. I don't want to make a vase for people to worship in a museum."
 Agincourt_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I don't allow your eyes to look away from me, I am the most exquisite artwork."
 Agincourt_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It doesn't matter if you don't know how to dance, give me your hand, and I will take you with you... You look so cute now."
 Santee_TouchDialog_1:0 "Would you like to buy the latest sunscreen?...Although fighting is very important, sunscreen is also indispensable. I heard that the commander likes...understand? It depends on you and me. I will give you a 20% discount. ."
 Santee_TouchDialog_2:0 "I have already given you today's turnover requirement. If you need to hire a few black mercenaries in the port area, the turnover requirement will be increased by another 10%. Please come on."
 Santee_TouchDialog_3:0 "Commander, the economy has been sluggish recently. Can you accommodate a little bit and lower the offshore tax a little bit, just a little bit, and I can give you a little bit of satisfaction to you."
 Santee_TouchDialog_4:0 "Today's bill, here... Commander, please allow me to leave for a while. Someone dare to make fraudulent accounts under my hands. I think it's death."
 Santee_TouchDialog_5:0 "If someone fights, someone is responsible for the logistics. I just take this opportunity to earn a cup of coffee money, isn't it too much?"
 Santee_TouchDialog_6:0 "Come on, give you a cup of coffee and help me count the goods. It's hard work. Rest early, so don't be found by those nasty people."
 Santee_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Miss Lexington, this thing is good for your health. I stayed up late the other day and you are exhausted. Don't worry, I will choose the products for you to ensure that you are getting younger and more beautiful."
 Santee_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "General Iowa, this is a treasure that I have treasured for a long time. I have given it to your sisters. Tomorrow, tomorrow I have a batch of important goods to be shipped here, so I will give it to your sisters!"
 Santee_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Recently, food and beverage expenses are a bit high. I want to ship a batch of interesting goods. You won't embarrass me, right? After all, you are the one I love."
 Santee_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Come on, here is my gift to you. It's hard work. Of course, you are not allowed to ask where you are from without emotion."
 Santee_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hey, pirates have been rampant lately. Those mercenaries said it was okay, but they didn't do anything at all. They were annoying. Commander, can you deduct their wages?"
 Santee_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I really don't want to do business with the group of people in Country S. They are all drunk, military discipline... cut, I know I am not qualified to talk about them."
 Argonaut_TouchDialog_1:0 "My hands...please don't care, sisters are more or less special, don't they?"
 Argonaut_TouchDialog_2:0 "There is no need to deliberately comfort me or take care of me. I am just an ordinary warrior just like my sisters."
 Argonaut_TouchDialog_3:0 "The gods are here, please bless me to find the Golden Fleece and resolve all disputes in this world."
 Argonaut_TouchDialog_4:0 "For ordinary people, this stuff may be a pain that cannot be bypassed in a lifetime. To me, these are just the marks of a fighter."
 Argonaut_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sirius, is she talking to the puppet alone? I suggest you don't disturb her unless you are ready to step into her world."
 Argonaut_TouchDialog_6:0 "Is that... the Prince of Wales? It would be too rude to disturb her at this time. But I seem to understand her sadness and unwillingness."
 Argonaut_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Come on, taste it, it's just out of the oven... Ah, is it hot to you? Sorry, I don't know this will be so hot. Drink some cold water slowly."
 Argonaut_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Are they coming?...Sorry, can I withdraw from this drill? My legs and legs are shaking, I'm sorry..."
 Argonaut_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Shame, shame, I messed up again... Commander, you can scold me, so I feel better..."
 Argonaut_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Why didn't I pray? Are you stupid? I have betrayed Athena when I am with you. She is magnanimous without cursing me. How dare I pray to her."
 Argonaut_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Well, I was actually quite scared at that time, afraid of not seeing the sisters who get along day and night, afraid of pain and death... I didn't expect that I still had that side."
 Argonaut_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "No matter how powerful the gods are in modern times, they are nothing more than ordinary people. Without human sacrifice, they have also lost their power. Therefore, there is no need to be afraid of being retaliated by Athena. She can only be sullen in life. That's it."
 Savannah_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hurry up! Keep those guided missile destroyers away from me! Commander...hurry up and order! I don't like mixing with this kind of little guy! This, what is this panda!"
 Savannah_TouchDialog_2:0 "Hurry up and train! Little guys! Don't think it's a destroyer and I will relax your standards. I'm not Langley. If the kid is disobedient, just hit it."
 Savannah_TouchDialog_3:0 "Did you forget that there is a meeting today? Why are you still sitting here. Hurry up and pack your things, I will escort you."
 Savannah_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sister, hasn't Phoenix come yet? Really, a dishonest fellow, you also said that she always hurts yourself so casually."
 Savannah_TouchDialog_5:0 "I like being a teacher, and I also like sailing aimlessly on the sea alone."
 Savannah_TouchDialog_6:0 "How did Alaska and Guam become like this?! No, don't come here! At least take your things away!"
 Savannah_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Get up--! If you sleep in, your ass may be blooming~"
 Savannah_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Would you like something to drink? I'm a little sleepy and need a glass of champagne to refresh myself. How about you? As the commander, you can't just drink, just give you a bottle of juice."
 Savannah_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Although I are sisters, my skin color is closer to Helena, and my personality is more similar to Phoenix. Brooklyn, where are we more similar?"
 Savannah_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Huh... After the injury, every time I see these missiles, I am afraid, and I must find a way to overcome it!!"
 Savannah_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Chang, Changchun, your little panda, can, can lend me...Ah! Jump, jump on me! Ah! Don't, I, can I... touch it?"
 Savannah_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh, it's amazing. Look at Changchun and Guam, Alaska. It's obviously a weapon, but it's so cute. I don't know what the people who make the equipment are thinking. Do this group of people want to be loved? Can't get a weapon?"
 Phoneix_TouchDialog_1:0 "When I was wandering outside, I met New Jersey. It was a delicate experience to meet my friends in a foreign country. I didn't expect her to come here earlier."
 Phoneix_TouchDialog_2:0 "Brooklyn...Ah, I should call you O'Higgins now? Your dress looks much better than before. It suits you well. Remember to teach me to dance another day!"
 Phoneix_TouchDialog_3:0 "Training is over, let's go swimming! Helena, do you want to come together! Don't worry about these things, the opportunity is rare, and you must cherish your whim!"
 Phoneix_TouchDialog_4:0 "Huh, it's cold at night, I really want to stay in a place where there is no night."
 Phoneix_TouchDialog_5:0 "Fire is really the source of everything, and it's getting more and more impossible to leave the stove at night."
 Phoneix_TouchDialog_6:0 "I get sleepy at night. If this happens during a battle, it will be over..."
  Phoneix_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Anything fun? The sun is good today, we can talk while walking."
 Phoneix_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Would you like a roast turkey? It's delicious~! This is my special skill, come, have a taste, if it's delicious, eat the whole one!"
 Phoneix_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Wandering and traveling in this world is the most romantic thing. When things are done here, come and go crazy with me again!"
 Phoneix_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "What steps are you taking in such a cold night, hurry up and sleep under the covers!"
 Phoneix_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Some people like the day and some people like the night, all because of the guidance of different destinies. So Commander, what do you like?"
 Phoneix_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "How does Savannah run so fast, ah, Changchun has hers... I seem to understand."
 Staling_TouchDialog_1:0 "Keeping warm is very important. We don't have feathers like birds, so we can only wear all kinds of textiles. My sweaters are naturally warm too. Wait, keep a distance, it will cause static electricity "
 Staling_TouchDialog_2:0 "Is my way of speaking very old-fashioned? (That's right.)-Even Kewo said that, that's true. However, I think this has become a habit and it is not so easy to change it. What should a girl of my age say?"
 Staling_TouchDialog_3:0 "Searching for submarines is a very time-consuming task. They are not fools and will not swagger to tell others where they are. (But that is just futile.) With Kevo and I, no submarine can escape."
 Staling_TouchDialog_4:0 "Kevo, don't eat so many sweets. (I won't gain weight again!) Yeah, this is your new excuse. (I'm healthy, you can tell by looking at my feathers!) Diabetes. (Goo!) Shedding hair. (Stop talking about it!)"
 Staling_TouchDialog_5:0 "My lucky number is "6"-just like my hull number. (For those submarines, it is a symbol of "devil".) It is the "devil" who strikes at innocent people. Acts. We will prevent this from happening."
 Staling_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, there is one thing I need your help. You have also said that my way of speaking is too old. So, can you teach me how to correct it? Of the people I can trust, only you have this ability. Why do I know? Because of... intuition."
 Staling_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 ""Loneliness"...This word is full of bleakness just to say it. However, I am lucky. I can meet you and be able to get rid of the unchanging life. In my mind, only "lucky" is left "."
 Staling_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Kevo is not just an ordinary starling. (That's right!) But if you continue to overeating and don't control sugar intake, you will get diabetes. (Shut up! I won't get that. !)"
 Staling_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sometimes, just ordinary statements of facts can make people laugh. Maybe my tone is too serious, which caused the sense of gap? Honestly, it’s hard to understand. What do you think? If you can, please, please Solve my doubts."
 Staling_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I have never heard the sound of ocean waves like this... Once, these sounds were insignificant noises. But now, with you by your side, these sounds suddenly become melodious-intertwined sonatas, like A great poem."
 Staling_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Meeting the right person can really change a person's life. Although the days we have experienced together are not so long, I believe that the road ahead must be full of light and hope."
 Staling_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "(...I almost forgot that she was just an ordinary girl. Thank you for being with her. Such a day is really great. Okay, take her back quickly. Could it be that Do you want me to fly back with her? Please, I am a starling!)"

 Kurohime_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Miss Nagato, I haven't seen you in a long time. Don't worry, Kashino is still by Missy's side. We only need to calm this troubled world and keep it away from the chaos of war and no longer need to wear armor..."
 Kurohime_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Two, let's stay for now. What kind of instrument is this? Why is this rhythm so that I can't feel at ease...Compare? Or, take the opportunity to release this fighting spirit, and maybe you can understand--"
 Kurohime_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "General, there is something I don't understand. Why is the current enemy so far from what the eldest lady dictates? Is it true? Next, I have a bad feeling..."
 Kurohime_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I never thought that I could set up a family before Missy...it is true that this world is not yet peaceful. But at Xia Ding, we should do our best to make the peace and prosperity in your heart a reality."
 Kurohime_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Miss Shinano, the night is late, and you haven't stopped? Haha, you are really becoming more and more like the eldest lady and the second lady. However, you have walked out of a path that belongs to you only. Next, You have to be more diligent."
 Kurohime_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Children of the destroyer, I feel terrifying underneath...General, do you have any solution? Look in the mirror...laugh? Just remember it, go back and try."
 Ariake_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hidden system, huh~ I said why I didn't find such a large complex here before. The times are moving forward, but I am about to become an "old guy" out of touch with the times."
 Ariake_TouchDialog_2:0 ""Doctor"...I don't like this word very much. Sorry~ It evokes some past events, don't care, this is not aimed at you. If you don't mind, I will just call you by name. A little bit. , Let me lean on the old and sell the old for a while~"
 Ariake_TouchDialog_3:0 "Horse racing is a very good sport. In a limited time, sweating and showing all of your past efforts. How can you not let your blood be broken? However, gambling is not a good thing~"
 Ariake_TouchDialog_4:0 "This set of equipment is not useful when hiking and climbing, otherwise it is more cumbersome. Huh? Why not take it off? If it is that simple~ it would be fine."
 Ariake_TouchDialog_5:0 "I didn't expect Elizabeth to be here, but she doesn't recognize me anymore. It's not just time that can make people forget the past. Haha, I'm kidding, don't take it seriously~"
 Ariake_TouchDialog_6:0 "Every time I think back to the past, I always think, "If I did this at the time...it might be..."-but what has happened, it can't be changed anyway. This world is so cruel ."
 Ariake_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Before I came here, I was indeed in a state of traveling the world. However, I have another purpose-that is to find the developer of this equipment and obtain the true "freedom" I dream of."
 Ariake_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I, I am a very boring person. So, I can only do some deviant things, and I thought maybe it would become interesting this way? But in the end things always backfire~"
 Ariake_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Is there no "Abyss" and our records in the existing archives? Oh, those guys dealt with things really well. You don't need to regret it, I will tell you slowly. I have to make a comeback in "Abyss" Before……"
 Ariake_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The power boarded in this ship suit is used to deal with the "Abyss". If the enemy is the "Deep Sea", it is a bit bullying. I pay a lot of attention to the sense of ritual. We should use equivalent weapons~"
 Ariake_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Oh~this is not Shinano! The last time we met was at the temple fair, do you remember me? The big sister who robbed you of your apple candy~haha, you remember it clearly. Um...your sister Is she... okay?"
 Ariake_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Have you noticed the defensive measures in this admiral’s room? Yes, you are usually busy with work, and you really don’t notice these little details. These gadgets are all she got from me, so Think, our fate is really not a little bit at all~"
 Kurama_TouchDialog_1:0 "Huh, you can enjoy the great location in the large public bath in the Minato area...Ah, I didn't deliberately hurt myself just to take more baths..."
 Kurama_TouchDialog_2:0 "Ah, it's Nagato... I feel that she is more kind now. What? Has she always been like that? It's strange..."
 Kurama_TouchDialog_3:0 "I always feel that the admiral has an inexplicable sense of intimacy. It may be because... ah, you still forgot what I just said?!"
  Kurama_TouchDialog_4:0 "Ah, I haven't eaten until this point. How about going to the cafeteria together?"
 Kurama_TouchDialog_5:0 "Are you busy reviewing documents? I'll help too! After all, I am a high-achieving student in economics and I am good at word processing...Huh? What does "I really didn't see"? What a rude!"
 Kurama_TouchDialog_6:0 "This is the end of today's work. Let's go to the bath and end the day with a comfortable bath~"
 Kurama_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "You can really relax in the admiral's room, even if you are lazy... Don't worry, my housework level has improved a lot, and cleaning the room is just a small matter~"
 Kurama_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "My sister used to smile and said that I could be alone, and I was scared that she would leave me for a long journey... but surely, there must be another day to see each other!"
 Kurama_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Are your shoulders sore again? Then I'll give you a massage...Ah, it's so stiff. If you don't pay attention to the regularity of work and rest and health problems, I will be angry..."
 Kurama_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Please look forward to my craftsmanship for dinner? After all, it is different from before. Cooking and housework must be studied carefully... Also, no leftovers are allowed anyway!"
 Kurama_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I stayed up late and worked hard. Take a short break and come and have a cup of tea. I learned the craft of making tea from my friends in country E, so this time it’s not a black tea bag, so stay tuned~"
 Kurama_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "You can go to the bath to relax later... Hey, do you want to take a bath together? Okay..."
 Macon_TouchDialog_1:0 "Justice, correctness, righteousness... these things are not something mortals like me can judge. Since the Lord will guide our hearts, then we only need to follow our own hearts."
 Macon_TouchDialog_2:0 "Is the eldest sister going out to do the task? I will pray for you and pray that you can return safely."
 Macon_TouchDialog_3:0 "In the Bible, disputes cannot be resolved when the Son comes to the world, and the Father died because of disputes. It is too difficult to resolve disputes with the power of mere mortals. Is this also a trial?"
 Macon_TouchDialog_4:0 "Everyone says that the army is strictly disciplined, but in my opinion, it is as beautiful as heaven. If so, if there is no war..."
 Macon_TouchDialog_5:0 "Me? I'm drawing picture books for destroyers and submarines. It would be too boring to fight and play every day. If you can read picture books to them, their lives can be more fulfilling."
 Macon_TouchDialog_6:0 "Miss De Grasse's glasses are always familiar to me, are they an illusion?...Huh? You think so too?"
 Macon_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "What are you thinking about? Can you tell me something? Maybe, it will give you a different guide."
 Macon_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I originally wanted to make breakfast today, but after some manipulation, I broke the coffee cup, broke the toaster, and..."
 Macon_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "With you by my side, I will feel that the world is extremely beautiful. Perhaps this is the hope that the Holy Father has given me."
 Macon_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Forgive me, if you let me help with the housework, I will definitely destroy this house. This is the curse of Satan..."
 Macon_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "In my impression, Miss Quincy can not eat everything. There is a dish, I forgot who made it. That was the first time I saw Miss Quincy and refused to try it."
 Macon_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Although you cannot lose to temptation, if you are facing me, you don't need to hide your love and obsession."
 Fuyutsuki_TouchDialog_1:0 "Humph~ My lord has already seen through your next move! Next, you willwow!? Don’t turn on the flash suddenly! Your eyes will be blinded and you won’t be able to see the enemy. Carrier-based aircraft!"
 Fuyutsuki_TouchDialog_2:0 "Huh, this lord has nothing to fear! All tangible things are paper tigers! Except...Wow!? Where did you get the sea cucumbers!? Get away quickly!"
 Fuyutsuki_TouchDialog_3:0 "Cough cough... I scream too loudly, my throat hurts. It’s really difficult to keep my toes high... But I can’t do that. If you lose your momentum, you will definitely be bullied by others. of……"
 Fuyutsuki_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sisters are too gentle...I really envy them to express their true self naturally. My words...probably because of this blindfold, I must...become strong..."
 Fuyutsuki_TouchDialog_5:0 "I'm really sorry... I've taken you so much to say so, it must have delayed your work. I, I will get the results to compensate you! I will go training now"
 Fuyutsuki_TouchDialog_6:0 "The quilt is so thick! It's just like being pressed by the cement board, it makes people completely breathless. Huh? There is no peace of mind like this, right!?"
  Fuyutsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Don't you think sea cucumbers are super scary? Obviously looking at the soft, but there is something like spikes on the body! After drying it, it is even more-don't don't! I don't touch it!! Forgive me! Bar!!!"
 Fuyutsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Strictly speaking, this suit is not a wetsuit, and I am a destroyer, so I can’t dive. It works... it’s better to dissipate heat... I always get overloaded by accident... Ha, Haha...so embarrassing..."
 Fuyutsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "What are you looking at? Wow! Wow! What is my novel?! You, where do you probably see? Hey! Don’t read it out! Forget it, forget it! This thing is simply Doesn't exist ah ah ah ah-"
 Fuyutsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I have tried to pull the swords of my sisters and others, but I couldn't pull them out at all, and I was hit on the head by the scabbard... This, this kind of thing is not everyone knows! If you want to say that, just play Show me a look! Hey oh-you really know how to do it??!!!"
 Fuyutsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Today's big demon... just use Liangyue! Obviously hit me and pretended not to see and quickly walked away, really annoying! Humph! Let this lord-the goddess blessing infinite power invincible The invincible Winter Moon! Defeat you and put you in prison!"
 Fuyutsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Just now I ran into a person who also wears a blindfold. He said something that he didn't understand at all. Is this the "Cooking Second Disease" mentioned in the magazine? It's terrible. This kind of person actually exists. Hey? Am I the same?! How, how is it possible!"
 Alvisedamosto_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hey? So am I not the first navigator class to come here? Who? Ugo? That's hard work for you."
 Alvisedamosto_TouchDialog_2:0 "Antonio, in the face of oppression, you have to learn to resist! Resist, know? Don’t be bullied by that guy all the time, understand? Besides her, I can also protect you."
 Alvisedamosto_TouchDialog_3:0 "Miss Pompeii! It's me! When we met last time, I was a scout cruiser, and now I have become a destroyer! By the way, is your opponent here too?"
 Alvisedamosto_TouchDialog_4:0 "Isn't this the Goddess of Aurora?... No no, that sentence was not provocative when I came. But I was a bit unconvinced about the original thing. If it were one-on-one, I wouldn't necessarily lose. "
 Alvisedamosto_TouchDialog_5:0 "A few of you mercenaries are here too?... You shouldn't do anything to leave your guests and run away?"
 Alvisedamosto_TouchDialog_6:0 "Miss Veneto, did anyone make you angry again?...Do you need me to kill that guy for you?"
 Alvisedamosto_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sir, I grew up with them. To put it bluntly, I am not trying to provoke the relationship between them, but that you should understand this truth better than me. Interdependence in war is not a good thing."
 Alvisedamosto_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Miss Harrier Eagle, you still like to take care of these flowers and plants. It's so beautiful, can you teach me another day? Sir, you have to come together!"
 Alvisedamosto_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Good morning, sir, I am always protecting you. Today, I want to behave like a baby. Today, you will protect me."
 Alvisedamosto_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Why do you care about Antonio? Because I have a friend who is also called Antonio. Every time I see her, I can't help but think of my sister. I don't know how my sister is now and how well it is."
 Alvisedamosto_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Tonight only belongs to you and me. Don't worry, everyone around me has been driven away by me. Hey, the method is kept secret!"
 Alvisedamosto_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "We are not mutually dependent, remember? As I said in the oath, once you decide who the protected person is, you are not allowed to go back."
 Togo_TouchDialog_1:0 "Huh-I didn't expect to return to the front line. How long have I left... I actually don't want to come back, but the money given above is too much."
 Togo_TouchDialog_2:0 "I have been observing you for a long time, sir, you have been staring at me, right? Why? Do you like it here, or here? No matter how you avoid your eyes, you can't deceive me~"
 Togo_TouchDialog_3:0 "Cut, that group of people don't know how to appreciate beauty at all, what they say is that it is not good to dress like this, and it is unsightly. What do they know. You should understand me, sir?"
 Togo_TouchDialog_4:0 "Why? I have something to do with me late at night, I always find it a bit difficult."
 Togo_TouchDialog_5:0 "My record is not worse than those soldiers who boast of excellent performance, but I am not good at dealing with this kind of thing, can I leave it to you?"
 Togo_TouchDialog_6:0 "Who can fascinate me, I will fight for whom. Is this hard to understand?"
 Togo_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Good morning, sir. Breakfast is ready, or is it...what else do you want to do before you eat?"
 Togo_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I made a cake, do you want to eat it?...Please, be sincere. Yes, that's it. Should I feed you? What should I do without reminding me?"
 Togo_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Don't worry, it will take half an hour to put on makeup. You can have a snack, play games, or watch TV. Don't worry, it will be soon."
 Togo_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I'm going to perform a night reconnaissance mission, don't stick to me, don't worry, I will be back before you wake up, good night."
 Togo_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Are you tired? Come on, come on your pillow. Although I don't know if you are really tired or fake, but...I like the way you rely on me."
 Togo_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I don't like fighting, because I am not good at it. If I really want to say, I am good at binding the heart of the one I love, why? Don't believe it? Do you want to try?"
 Lyon_TouchDialog_1:0 "Agincourt, do you want to have a competition?"
  Lyon_TouchDialog_2:0 "Why are there fewer and fewer gun barrels on new battleships? Is this really enough firepower?"
 Lyon_TouchDialog_3:0 "The training is over, I feel really uncomfortable in sweat, Richelieu, do you want to take a bath together? Don't be so rigid, learn to relax when you need to relax, walk around, I can give you a full body massage! "
 Lyon_TouchDialog_4:0 "Huh, this day is busy till night, and there is no time to maintain the gun barrel. General, please come and help me, you need necessary exercise after dinner, otherwise you will gain weight."
 Lyon_TouchDialog_5:0 "It's no surprise to have a little wine in the evening? Or, do you want to have a drink with me?"
 Lyon_TouchDialog_6:0 "Dunkirk, are you trying to compete with me in swordsmanship? Or, the general hasn't tried my swordsmanship before, so let me do it for you. Take it!"
 Lyon_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Good morning, General. Would you like a glass of red wine for refreshing? This is produced in Château Lussialus, which is rare on the market."
 Lyon_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The opera house is open...ah! General, I am not feeling well, you can go with me to see my illness, go here, as long as I watch this opera, my illness will be cured. Okay~ "
 Lyon_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Are you going out? Wait a moment and let me change my clothes. Yes! It's your favorite...hehe, don't rush me, who makes you like it."
 Lyon_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "A glass of red wine, the sea breeze in the evening, and fireworks are the most comfortable way to live. No, no, the fireworks on the screen are not good. You must be right in front of you. General, can you hold a firework festival in the port area? ?"
 Lyon_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "General, you are blushing. Are you drunk? Hee hee, just a little red wine on your head, it's really cute."
 Lyon_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I like drama, travel, and wine tasting. You like to learn martial arts and sing songs with warriors. We have walked different paths, but now we have reached the same destination by different routes. This is also a special fate between you and me. Richelieu, dry Have a glass, count me to toast you. These years, you have worked so hard."
 Agano_TouchDialog_1:0 "Huh...Although it would be lonely not to see my sisters, bad things will happen when we stay together...It's really strange, don't you think so?"
 Agano_TouchDialog_2:0 "Meticulous calculation results are the only way to win. Recent newcomers rely too much on system-assisted calculations. This is not a good thing. The times are progressing, but you can't let yourself regress."
 Agano_TouchDialog_3:0 "I am still immature and took over the flagship position of Team Ten. There is still a lot I need to learn, and there is no room for slack. Can you teach me? How can I become a competent leader... …some type of."
 Agano_TouchDialog_4:0 "After confirming the operation of the boiler, you can feel relieved now. Ah, this is nothing, you don't have to worry about me. If you feel sick, you have to solve it by yourself."
 Agano_TouchDialog_5:0 "I don't like fish very much... Ah, it's not because it's not delicious! I didn't mean it! Just... I always feel that I will drink a lot of water after eating... Isn't it weird?"
 Agano_TouchDialog_6:0 "Ms. Dadian is so cunning that she doesn't want to let me touch Ziyun. Obviously, it only takes a moment, and I won't steal her. Oh, I want to carry Ziyun too!"
 Agano_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The No. 1 turret has insufficient ammunition, and the ammunition depot loading operation begins-ah wait! There is the No. 2 turret over there! Is the system malfunctioning again?! Wait, stop it!!"
 Agano_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Life is like a journey. It is completely impossible to predict what kind of people you will meet and what will happen during this journey. However, I was fortunate to meet you. This journey has one more Someone to rely on."
 Agano_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Everyone has something they are not good at. I don't think it is a shame. No one is perfect, even machines can make mistakes, let alone ordinary people."
 Agano_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I hope that the kid who is chasing the wind can eat on time, and don't forget it because of training. Now she is growing up, so she can't neglect these... Well, let's post an email."
 Agano_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Do you need me to help you do something? I just finished writing my diary, and I am free now. Hey? Want to see my diary?! What a shame on this, this...oh, just, just this time!"
 Agano_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Like it, you don’t have to talk about it. Like it, it will naturally blend into your expression and action. You said~ right? Well, I know. Please wait a moment, I will bring my stomach warm The food came back."
 KrasnyKavkaz_TouchDialog_1:0 "Comrade Commander, your previous performance in the battle really impressed me (warm embrace)"
 KrasnyKavkaz_TouchDialog_2:0 "No matter how strong a fortress is, it will be destroyed by a giant artillery like Dora. You should take the initiative in battle."
 KrasnyKavkaz_TouchDialog_3:0 "Cannonball doesn't care who you are."
 KrasnyKavkaz_TouchDialog_4:0 "Thank you for listening to me. Black Death also has a fragile side..."
 KrasnyKavkaz_TouchDialog_5:0 "The black death of the Black Sea is not only good at naval battles."
  KrasnyKavkaz_TouchDialog_6:0 "Want to hear my glorious battle trail, it will take a long time to talk about it."
 KrasnyKavkaz_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Flowers and hugs are indispensable every day."
 KrasnyKavkaz_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I may not be good at those sweet words, I am better at direct attack."
 KrasnyKavkaz_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Alcohol between battles is precious. Let's take a swig. It doesn't matter, I will help you."
 KrasnyKavkaz_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I may not be good at acting, but if you like it, you can play with me as much as you want."
 KrasnyKavkaz_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "My dear comrade, why are you timid? Were you not very bold during the previous ceremony."
 KrasnyKavkaz_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I actually prefer long hair, but war does not allow this."
 Halford_TouchDialog_1:0 "Is it rare to see a destroyer as big as me? To be honest, I was forced to install a strange catapult for this reason. Looks a bit stupid? It's the engineer's fault anyway..."
 Halford_TouchDialog_2:0 "This softball is part of the armor, but don't think I am indulging in playing."
 Halford_TouchDialog_3:0 "There are many sisters in the port area, but they are not interested in the topic of team formation. It seems that I am not very gregarious and troublesome... Do you have any suggestions for the chief?"
 Halford_TouchDialog_4:0 "Dr. Yubari was very curious about my ship's outfit during the day, and I also asked her to help me remove the catapult and put it back into the torpedo, but she just ran away with the sentence "I'll talk about it next time"... "
 Halford_TouchDialog_5:0 "According to my observation, the chief spends less than one hour outdoors every day. It seems necessary for you to accompany me to practice throwing and catching the ball."
 Halford_TouchDialog_6:0 "It’s midnight snack time. Today, there are fried chicken and French fries in the cafeteria. How about I bring a serving for the chief? Humph, as long as there is enough exercise, there is no need to worry about food."
 Halford_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Huh? I'm just practicing throwing for a while. Hey, don't stare at it with a strange expression. I'm sorry..."
 Halford_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I have personally experienced indescribable battlefields. I have witnessed the gorgeous fireworks over the Philippine sea, and the dense beams of light on the sea surface of Surigao. I thought that the exciting moment will not come again until you hand it over. The day I put the ring..."
 Halford_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Now you have to listen to my complaints: the kingfisher is very useful, and the throwing action is cool. The sisters look envious, but it is really annoying to recycle this kid."
 Halford_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Recently, I have practiced too many times. My shoulders are sore. Give me a massage. That's right, it's here, ah, I feel comfortable... Where are you rubbing now?"
 Halford_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "My dear, am I spoiling you too much? From tomorrow, I will urge you to increase the amount of exercise. A healthy body is the foundation of everything. Don't worry if you have a professional coach like me. There is no excuse for being lazy. !"
 Halford_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "My dream? I once agreed with Pringle and Stevens to team up after the war, but then everyone forgot. Now, guess?"
 oldLion_TouchDialog_1:0 "You used to be... the arrogant face told me to defeat my little girl, but now she has grown into an adult. It feels really good, except for this subtle height difference."
 oldLion_TouchDialog_2:0 "I'm not a kid, don't lower your head and talk to me!"
 oldLion_TouchDialog_3:0 "Miss Hood is a leader. I admire her elegance and stability. Of course, if she wants to go further, she needs some overlord ambitions."
 oldLion_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's time for rest...Don't look at me with the eyes of children, isn't rest at this time a manifestation of healthy work and rest!"
 oldLion_TouchDialog_5:0 "I really envy you with such advanced equipment, I also want to change these old equipment...Really? Go, let's try it!"
 oldLion_TouchDialog_6:0 "Miss war exhaustion, and Miss Elizabeth, long time no see. You have been in this port area for a long time, can you tell me what happened?"
 oldLion_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "There are more and more companions who can drink afternoon tea together, which is a good thing. But recently, it seems that the number of times people fight to add milk or tea first has also increased. Of course, I am a tea party first. ."
 oldLion_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The younger generations have grown up to this point. I am very happy, but also a little unwilling."
 oldLion_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Commander, my hair is a bit messy, can you comb it for me?...Ah, it hurts, don't use too much force, lighten it."
 oldLion_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The cloak is so handsome to be worn like this! Don't ask me why! I learned it from TV!"
  oldLion_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The hair is messed up again, it's really troublesome... Fortunately, I have you by my side. Come, stretch my legs, and I'm going to rest."
 oldLion_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Portsmouth...Is Miss Lion's wish to go there? How about tomorrow? I will show you a different world."
 Duquesne_TouchDialog_1:0 "Is that all for today's training? Then I will go out to play after training."
 Duquesne_TouchDialog_2:0 "The one called Maryland, the one wearing oversized gloves, and...the strong are like clouds, I can fight as much as I want!"
 Duquesne_TouchDialog_3:0 "Many living habits here are different from my hometown. If I did something wrong, please forgive me!"
 Duquesne_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hey? I thought everyone would go to bed on time here. I didn't expect it to be so lively outside at night. It just so happens that I will have a big fight too!"
 Duquesne_TouchDialog_5:0 "Let go of me! Let go! You see that they are also arguing, those two are still fighting, don't you care?! Let go, why did you catch me!"
 Duquesne_TouchDialog_6:0 "I have seen General Richelieu crying and sighing alone late at night, but she never shows the slightest weakness in front of everyone. Maybe this is where she is strong."
 Duquesne_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Breakfast? Just roast this piece of meat. Is there anything special about it?"
 Duquesne_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "This is the last bubble gum, let's go, accompany me out to buy candy. To me, this is as important as life."
 Duquesne_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Is General Richelieu's sword swinging handsome? Can you? Come and try. If you can swing the sword so handsomely, I might love you more."
 Duquesne_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Why join here? Then I need to ask, because General Richelieu is so handsome, I want to be like her. Although she doesn't admit it, I already regard her as my master in my heart!"
 Duquesne_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Come on for dinner! Diquesne’s special grilled meat!! How?...Hey? Isn’t it just a week of grilling? What's wrong with you, you don’t look very good."
 Duquesne_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Look at you... are you busy? Although I have not learned how to do this kind of thing, if you are willing to teach me, I will help you complete it."
 Flander_TouchDialog_1:0 "You have worked hard... General Richelieu? Are you too tired? Don't worry, I will definitely reduce your work pressure in the future."
 Flander_TouchDialog_2:0 "I can share your worries for you, General. My existence is for this, so you don't have to worry about it."
 Flander_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hood? What are you doing here?... I won't accept your apology, listen, even if General Richelieu forgave you, I will... you go."
 Flander_TouchDialog_4:0 "Is General Richelieu struggling to support these years?... As the name suggests, she is the last light of the F's navy."
 Flander_TouchDialog_5:0 "General, are you free? Tell me about the story of this port area. I am familiar with her past, but I am still very new to it."
 Flander_TouchDialog_6:0 "General, are you interested in chatting with me about your understanding of the battle situation?...It's nothing, don't be nervous, this is just our small talk, we can't count it."
 Flander_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "It turns out that these guys in Germany are not totally unreasonable...what? You said I like them, how could it be possible, what are you kidding about."
 Flander_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "For me, it’s not impossible to join forces with the guys in Country E, but all of this is based on your orders and requests. My personal feelings are unacceptable. So, you know that I have paid for you. How much?"
 Flander_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Alsace clearly said that she arrived in the port area earlier than me... Could it be that she went to the wrong place? Wouldn't she be lost?!"
 Flander_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Forgive Hood?...Even if you come to me to intercede, I will not agree. Maybe she made the best choice based on her own position, but I just hate her for no reason."
 Flander_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It used to be you, now it is you. Although the title has changed, your position in my heart has never been shaken."
  Flander_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Me? I'm reading vampire novels... There are so many legends about vampires in Europe, they are all interesting. Would you like to see them together? I can tell you many stories about them!"
 Mogador_TouchDialog_1:0 "Huh-did that little fellow Volta arrive before me?... No way, whoever makes her like Pompeii so much, just let her go."
 Mogador_TouchDialog_2:0 "The meaning of timing is to remind yourself of the importance of punctuality. Of course, it is also important to watch time. After all, not everyone has a strong sense of time."
 Mogador_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey-fantasy, are you racing against people again?... Well, I have to practice more fighting skills. It makes no sense to have speed."
 Mogador_TouchDialog_4:0 "After work is off, I will not work overtime during working hours. Unless... Will you pay me overtime? I will strictly time it."
 Mogador_TouchDialog_5:0 "Go, let's watch the excitement together tonight. It is said that Volta will fight Pompeii for three hours tonight. Is there anything more interesting than this?"
 Mogador_TouchDialog_6:0 "At night, I can't estimate the time through the sun, nor can I feel the passage of time. I don't like it very much."
 Mogador_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I made breakfast. The best time to eat is within half an hour, so... don't sleep in bed! Five minutes later, I want to see you at the table!"
 Mogador_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Weird, didn't you promise me that this job should be done within two hours? Why? It's been three minutes later, isn't it a laziness in the middle?... It's unforgivable to delay the appointment."
 Mogador_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Okay, perfect calculation. No one will bother us in this office for the next 1 hour and 30 minutes. So, do you want to come to a romantic two-person world?"
 Mogador_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "General Richelieu!...Huh, every time I see General Richelieu I feel very nervous. I don't know if it's because she is too majestic. Huh? General Richelieu will you too?"
 Mogador_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Ha-I'm a little sleepy, I, I can stay with you for an hour at most. If you exceed it, please, trouble you... Just carry me back. Call-call -"
 Mogador_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It would be great if time can be stopped. No matter how much time I spend with you, I don’t feel enough."
 L20_TouchDialog_1:0 "Everyone in the port area came here earlier than me. They are my predecessors in combat and life. I still have a lot to learn."
 L20_TouchDialog_2:0 "If you use too much force during training, you may injure your friend, but if you don't use your full strength, it will be meaningless. It's a headache..."
 L20_TouchDialog_3:0 "Aren't they two rivals? You can actually let them fight together. Is this what you are good at?"
 L20_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hindenburg is much gentler than before. Is it my illusion? Or is it your credit?"
 L20_TouchDialog_5:0 "If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I couldn't believe that there is such a beautiful place in the world."
 L20_TouchDialog_6:0 "It's very quiet here, I like it very much. Even if the future battle is over, I will stay here, how about you? ... It's nothing, I just ask casually."
 L20_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Oops, the promise was too simple, but I didn't know how to cook...what should I do, is it too late to learn? Or it seems that I should treat this as my own personality, which seems pretty good?"
 L20_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Speaking of which, the most surprising thing about coming to the Minato area is... The original Tirbitz-sama, who has always been called the queen, is an otaku. I have always regarded her as my idol... ..."
 L20_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sir, do you want to go out together?... Although I don't know what to play or where to go, the sisters all let me say that. Ah, wait a minute... Is that? I understand. Today, I'll leave it to you."
 L20_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I have witnessed the death enemy turned into a comrade-in-arms here, and saw the violent become good. You really are a miracle person."
 L20_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Do you want to take a break? Would you like to try the eye mask I made? It can help you fall asleep quickly and relieve fatigue. By the way, how about my new massage?"
 L20_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh-the officer praised me just now, praised me~ I'm going to learn more skills next weekend, hey, I don't feel tired at all, let's go to Tilbitz to learn some interesting knowledge !"
 Surrey_TouchDialog_1:0 "Save money... Yeah, I'm very sorry for spilling the tea! Whenever I hear the word "cut", I can't help but tremble with fear. Surrey has lost his temper, please forgive me!"
 Surrey_TouchDialog_2:0 "Prestige dear... Yes, I'm very sorry, I will keep the details of cleaning and tidying in mind, and I will correct it immediately."
  Surrey_TouchDialog_3:0 "My foot strength can't be compared to the county sisters. The only place I can be proud of is armor? Hey, I really hope Northumberland will be here soon..."
 Surrey_TouchDialog_4:0 "The nightingale with sweet tone, the hardworking owl, which type does the owner prefer? This is just looking at the night and remembering the old story of my hometown. Please don't be offended."
 Surrey_TouchDialog_5:0 "Does the master want to stay up late? I know, Surrey will also be by your side, waiting for instructions at any time."
 Surrey_TouchDialog_6:0 "The master is still energetic in the silent night, but I always have an indescribable sense of anxiety... Don't care, I will feel at ease by your side."
 Surrey_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I learned some tea art skills from the maid Shropshire, and I will be able to make scented tea for you in the future. In return, I also taught her a few dishes, but surprisingly, the ingenious Shropshire The county's only lack of talent in cooking..."
 Surrey_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Uneasy? I am very satisfied now, even if the past abandoned is unforgettable, even if the sudden feeling of helplessness strikes, it is enough to be with you."
 Surrey_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Ah... I'm sorry, I just stared at your side face at work, I hope it doesn't disturb the master. Let me try not to say "Sorry"? Okay, it's up to you."
 Surrey_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Master's health is the highest priority, so late at night, let me serve you early and lie down."
 Surrey_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Eh, am I going to smile casually now? Speaking of expression management, since I showed this expression because of you, please ask the master to supervise my smile practice, right?"
 Surrey_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "All the chores have been taken care of for you. No matter what the master does, Surrey will accompany you. It must be a good day tomorrow..."
 Nowaki_TouchDialog_1:0 "If I hadn't come to this port area, where would I be wandering now..."
 Nowaki_TouchDialog_2:0 "Wufeng? Wufeng! Are you here too!... Ah, it's Miss Hillman from Country U. Sorry, I mistakenly recognized the person. Yeah, you look alike, but you look alike There is still a difference...you are not her after all."
 Nowaki_TouchDialog_3:0 "Oh? Are you talking about that naval battle? I really miss that time. Even though Wufeng and I tried our best, in the end we were no match for the new warships of U."
 Nowaki_TouchDialog_4:0 "If I took off this sun-type uniform, who would I be... Will it be Teruetsu? Or Fuzuki?"
 Nowaki_TouchDialog_5:0 "Ah, it's Miss New Jersey and Miss Iowa. I have worked hard today. I always feel that Wufeng and I will grow up like you... But, will we still grow up?"
 Nowaki_TouchDialog_6:0 "Admiral, are you looking for Xuefeng? She seems to have gone to play with Zhuma just now..."
 Nowaki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "This letter...I can't see it clearly. Admiral, can you help me see it?"
 Nowaki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Dancing style! Ah...aloha? It turned out to be Miss Hillman, what can I do? Take me to see your Fletcher sister? Okay, I happen to be free, let's go."
 Nowaki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "You ask Hagifu? Lan doesn't remember her...no wonder, she shouldn't remember her anymore. Such painful memories, who will keep in mind and never forget... these things... Probably only I remember..."
 Nowaki_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Fernando Pessoa's "Paused Records"? What kind of book is this? In short, thank you the admiral, I will read it-after finding the dance style."
 Nowaki_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Wufeng is the youngest child in the fourth expulsion team...Where will she be waiting for us now? Don't cry, Wufeng. I will find you for sure-definitely."
 Nowaki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Tomorrow... I'm going to that place again. If I don't come back at this time tomorrow, please let my life go on, as if nothing happened."
 Hood_TouchDialog_1:0 "After the transformation, the ammunition depot should be much safer..."
 Hood_TouchDialog_2:0 "Daily training must not be relaxed, but... can you stay with me?"
 Hood_TouchDialog_3:0 "Ah, sir, have you seen ginger and fish cakes? I really don't know where they went..."
  Hood_TouchDialog_4:0 "I have been to many places, and your harbor is my favorite."
 Hood_TouchDialog_5:0 "The Prince of Wales and prestige, they must also be able to carry the glory of the Royal Navy and move on."
 Hood_TouchDialog_6:0 "Pay special attention to your body when you work at night. I made snacks and black tea for you... Well, please take a break."
 Hood_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The commander called me? Could it be that the work can't be completed? Hehe, it's not impossible to help you, but I have to wait until my training is over."
 Hood_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "It's really fun to watch the younger generations grow up...Huh? Commander, why do you look at me with that kind of praise, you have to fight for this... Hehe~ It's really cute."
 Hood_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Does the commander like cats? Ginger and fish cakes are inseparable from me~"
 Hood_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Commander, you have been to a lot of places, where is your favorite? ... I, as long as I can accompany the commander and be with you. My favorite is the place where you are ."
 Hood_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hey...what did you call me so mysterious? Is this black tea... Commander, did you make it? Okay, let me try it... It's pretty good, I can feel what you like, Commander. ."
 Hood_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Commander, can I trouble you to sit next to me?...It's really broad shoulders. It's nice to have you by my side."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_1:0 "It turned out to be a naval battle... Is this luck or misfortune? Ruiyun, you don't want to say anything-oh, what are my complaints about the water plane..."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_2:0 "Really, how did this kid disappear in the blink of an eye... It seems that the final adjustment must be done by us. Come on, don't lose to them."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_3:0 "I am also very happy to look at their unrestrained appearance. No one wants to worry about this and that all day, right? Holding a cup of hot tea like this, watching the sunset, how pleasant... Ah, The tea is cold..."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_4:0 "No matter how splendid the cherry blossoms are, there will be a day when they wither. Before that, bloom as much as possible to offer the last fragrance to the world."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_5:0 "There is still a lot of things I want to say, and a lot of things I want to do... However, there is still time left. Now I am satisfied as long as I stay in this port area."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_6:0 "Where did this bento box come from? Look at this pattern... it's her again. This child, at least give someone a chance to thank you in person... What a fool."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "They stayed in the shrine on the mountain all day, and their life was quite poor...sometimes they also have to come to Minato to show up and communicate with everyone more. Alas..."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Probably it is an illusion, I always feel that the wrinkles have increased... Admiral, you can help me-hey, nothing, just want to call you on a whim. Sorry, I hope I didn't disturb you."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Yesterday I "accidentally" saw the doctor's new project blueprint. It is a new triple-mounted main gun. If that can be equipped for me... it won't be me anyway, so don't expect it... "
 Fusou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I'm not afraid of ghosts and things at all, probably because it's too unlucky, even ghosts don't want to approach me... I'm just kidding~ How come there is such a thing~ ah?"
 Fusou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I can confuse matcha with wasabi. Is it cute or terrible? Well...then, who brought this box of matcha cakes on the table..."
 Fusou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Although I have raised small animals, they will eventually disappear inexplicably... I obviously closed the cage properly. Where did they go?"
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_1:0 "The two sisters took different paths...just like us, with a slightly ironic ending. Sister, don't talk about it, I don't want to be like this..."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_2:0 "This is a new type of main gun. Although it cannot be compared with the adult in terms of caliber, it also has its own unique side. Hmm... I don't quite understand it. The previous sentence is the original words of the doctor..."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_3:0 "Sister, I can help adjust the carrier aircraft... but only you can make them fly, and I will cheer for you on the side. Don't be discouraged, strength can't be changed by luck."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_4:0 "To be honest, I am a little envious of my sister, those carrier-based aircraft look very cute, I really want to hold them in my arms...Ah, the enemy's, falling into the yellow spring is their best ending."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_5:0 "Living is the happiest thing. With relatives and those hard-working younger generations beside me, there is no time to complain about myself. Every tomorrow is full of new hope."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_6:0 "You're so considerate. It's really hard for you to make a midnight snack for two for fear of trouble. Thank you, go to bed, there will be a training camp tomorrow morning, don't be late."
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I heard that a hot spring has been newly built in the Minato area recently. I don't know if it is true... I really want to soak, but this is the only thing I can't give up...!"
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Now I will also make some model boats, which is quite interesting. Unfortunately, some boards are out of print due to the age and can only be made by themselves. In this case, the time consumed will double... "
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "After staying with her for a long time, will she share some of her luck? Hey, although it is something I can't ask for, I still want it... I want to be more lucky!"
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Admiral, I made a sukiyaki pot, would you like to try it? The steaming sukiyaki pot is perfect for the night~ By the way, there is also shochu, let me pour you a glass too! "
 Yamashiro_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "This is... the best wagyu! Who put it here? Oops, I can't help but want to cut it open... Hurry, come and stop me personally!"
  Yamashiro_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "One. If you don’t pay attention! What should you do... If you are discovered-have you seen it? Have you seen it all? Stand obediently, don’t run~"
 Ise_TouchDialog_1:0 "You can come here to pray for blessings and fulfil your wishes. The shrine exists for this. There must be a cause and fate if you are thinking about it in your heart."
 Ise_TouchDialog_2:0 "The carrier-based aircraft that I was looking forward to is now fulfilling its duties. "Ruiyun" is really a good name."
 Ise_TouchDialog_3:0 "Admiral, what kind of dream do you have? No matter what kind of attitude the dream exists, it is the "new" you yearn for. Change may only require a small opportunity."
 Ise_TouchDialog_4:0 "Stars, moonlight, beautiful. This is the first time I feel how lucky it is to be "alive"."
 Ise_TouchDialog_5:0 "Every bit of a weekday is an unforgettable memory. It is the small changes of each day that make us who we are now."
 Ise_TouchDialog_6:0 "Well, this has accumulated a lot of paperwork. Without the help of others, you may find it difficult to rest. Why not, let me help you."
 Ise_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "In this vast world, there are countless gods. People who are not determined to pursue faith are like finding a needle in a haystack. How can people who lose themselves from the root find their spiritual sustenance?"
 Ise_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "After the mood matures, it will naturally change in other aspects, such as saying some jerky and incomprehensible words? Ha, is the remark just now a bit confusing? In fact, it was just a casual mention, not What practical significance."
 Ise_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Fight against youkai? No, I am not that kind of witch. Let’s say, what kind of witch is in your eyes? It’s not the Heian era anymore. Youkai has already become history. "Peace", it is. Talking about the current world."
 Ise_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The bald eagle speaks really arrogantly, and it makes me rare to have the idea of ​​wanting to be rough. Tsk... It's just a microphone. Ahem, I made you laugh, let us continue to work. ."
 Ise_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huh? Are you hungry? I'm sorry, there is nothing to entertain you in the shrine... Ah, it's not because of the lack of money, but there is simply no habit of reserving food here. Wait... What do you suspect with that look in your eyes?!"
 Ise_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "As an art carrier, "Rakuyu" has not been widely disseminated. It is a pity. Isn't life full of these "regrets"? But as long as you have the courage to face it! These are just trivial things. !"
 Hyuuga_TouchDialog_1:0 "Pious faith means "dependence" for me. What I believe in is just a simple thing. Guess what it is~"
 Hyuuga_TouchDialog_2:0 "Broken things must be discarded in time~ Phew, after dismantling the turret, it is a lot easier. This way you can fight better, ha!"
 Hyuuga_TouchDialog_3:0 "Is it "opportunity for change"? How is change? If you only look at people's attitude and tone, it might be acting~haha~"
 Hyuuga_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hah! I finally said that handsome line! It can be regarded as the end of a dream~"
 Hyuuga_TouchDialog_5:0 ""Here, no compromise! "Ha~ how does it sound? But the previous sentence is more handsome, so I won't change it~"
 Hyuuga_TouchDialog_6:0 "A decent one is more in line with the image of my sister, which suits my taste very well. And I have collected enough beliefs, this is not a win-win situation~"
 Hyuuga_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Faith" is not blind obedience. If you give up thinking and only listen to the so-called "gospel", will you become a puppet who only obeys orders? But looking at you, I’m afraid I only believe in myself... Plus me~ this is the answer with full marks~"
 Hyuuga_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I can't take care of such a big shrine just by Ise sister and I. Thanks to the children who came to help in their free time, they are really enthusiastic~ But if you are willing to stay and become a witch, it would be better~ although I can only work part-time~"
 Hyuuga_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The encounter between you and me is destined~ Haha, this line is too stupid! The taste of cheap romance novels is permeated everywhere~ Ah, do you like it? I think so, after all, you are very Easily emotional type~"
 Hyuuga_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "You said there is a smell of wine on my body? No, I just came back from the wine cellar and didn't drink. I will not forget the rules that I should follow during work, just like my faith in the Lord God ~"
 Hyuuga_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I’ve known each other for so long, and I’m not a kid anymore. Ha... "Emotion"? It’s a bit difficult for me, so just skip this topic. What? ...I'm not shy! What's so shy about this!"
 Hyuuga_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Would you like something to eat? I have a lot of canned food here! Carambola, pineapple, oranges-everything, limited to fruits~ Don't eat foods that are too high in calories at this time. Come on, Zhang Open your mouth, ah"
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_1:0 "I never think about what to do if I fail, because it is not necessary."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_2:0 "Shooting a man first shoots a horse, catching a thief first catches a king. I think this old saying is correct."
  Bismarck_TouchDialog_3:0 "Only comprehensive protection can be invincible in battle."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_4:0 "I can never lose. Because behind me, there are people who need protection."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_5:0 "A night full of unknowns always comes with danger. Don't let your guard down."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_6:0 "The sir has finished his day's work? Please go to rest first, and I will check my equipment."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The recent missions are so boring, I really want to take you out with you, at least the road will not be boring."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "This kind of weather is most suitable for exercise...Sir, do you want to go to the suburbs with me to get some wind."
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Huh-it's amazing...Haha, Tirbitz, do you want to do another one? Be more serious, or you will lose the game!"
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Sir, there is a custom in my hometown. Lovers need to kiss and kiss each other before they parte... Ahhhhh, what lines are these, Tirbitz, I can't go on! Too, too Shame!"
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Huh-I'm tired... Sir, please don't make up some of the plots in the novel like Tirbitz. It doesn't work for me... But it is indeed a little tired. My eyelids are fighting, or Lean on your shoulders...whoop"
 Bismarck_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "What book are you reading, so hiding (robbing)... Hey, do you like this figure? What a bad taste..."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_1:0 "Work must be taken seriously, but you can't make a small difference... (rubbing eyes) Sorry, what did you just say?"
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_2:0 "People can change. Time, events, environment... There are countless conditions that can make people change. The reason for my change is only one of them."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_3:0 "This bunch of flowers... please don't take it to heart. It's just an item that exists to alert yourself."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_4:0 "The stars in the night... evoke some memories from the past."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_5:0 "Your work should be done independently... I can indeed help... Only this time, please remember."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_6:0 "Actually, those cowards are not afraid of me, but of things they don't know."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sir, it's still time for duty. I will leave those words in private. I...will listen carefully...because...it's you..."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "...is a very clichéd story. The brave saved the world...and then won the princess's heart. The so-called "love at first sight"...is not reliable. Only time walking together is the most real. Just like...you Same as me."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "In this small cassette, a whole world is contained... It's amazing. The world we live in... Is it a microcosm of the cassette? Impossible... You are real Yes, I can feel it."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Still looking through these documents...can I spare some time to drink this cup of coffee? I just brewed it...according to the taste you like...I hope it will relieve your fatigue."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Maybe... it's really... Oscar? Why did you come here... to accompany me, um, thank you. I have some cookies here... sir? You are here too, could it be that you brought it? Did you come here? Yes...Thank you very much..."
 Tirpitz_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Sister... can't you be too used to Oscar... she's been bullying ginger again...couldn't, you let it do this? Didn't you? It's not good... but you can't be a bad boy."
 Nelson_TouchDialog_1:0 "29 knots? Hmm...is something wrong? If there is anything I don't know, it's speed."
 Nelson_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sister? She is always conscientious, prudent and thorough. Except... just like me."
 Nelson_TouchDialog_3:0 "As a soldier, you should be able to break through the old dogma, break through the traditional strategic and tactical principles, and be good at displaying originality and initiative in battle. Only in this way can you become stronger."
 Nelson_TouchDialog_4:0 "A good commander always knows how to discipline himself... Compliment? I must have misphrased... Actually, I want to say! Where is your hand touching!?"
 Nelson_TouchDialog_5:0 "Hood and the Prince of Wales are excellent people, and they are trusted objects at all times."
 Nelson_TouchDialog_6:0 "Do you want to organize the materials? It's a headache. I suggest you find Rodney. I am only good at holding weapons. These things are not suitable for me."
 Nelson_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "You also like hunting? This is really unexpected...then, take your gun and let's go together."
 Nelson_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I feel a little uncomfortable recently...Huh? This is the black tea you made by yourself?...Um-the taste is a little worse... Next time, I will teach you to make black tea? How about?"
 Nelson_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Please pay more attention during work. This is your responsibility. If you have any thoughts, let me take a look after the work is over~"
 Nelson_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Are you sleepy?...Huh, still trying? You can't open your eyes anymore. Let's take a break. I'll call you later... Then, Commander, you want to sleep with me. Shoulder or leg?"
 Nelson_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, when I no longer need to go out to fight, can I stay by your side as I do now?...No, I don't need to tell me this answer now. I would rather see it than hear it."
 Nelson_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Rodney! You again... I said that I won't say that again, no matter how you beg me, it's useless!... Ah-really, this is the last time! Listen up : England expects everyone to fulfill their responsibilities! Are you satisfied?"
 Rodney_TouchDialog_1:0 "England hopes that everyone will do it... Hey! Commander, why are you here! When did you start... Ahhhh... please stop talking!"
 Rodney_TouchDialog_2:0 "Bismarck? If you wish, Commander... you will never lose to her!"
  Rodney_TouchDialog_3:0 "The sea breeze in the Atlantic Ocean is really nostalgic."
 Rodney_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, are you here? I'm sorry to interrupt your work and rest... Well, can you accompany me for a walk on the beach?"
 Rodney_TouchDialog_5:0 "I have arranged the speech files that need to be prepared for you. I look forward to your wonderful performance."
 Rodney_TouchDialog_6:0 "I heard that there is a mysterious fleet in the North Sea. Their flagship is terrible... I really want to see it in person."
 Rodney_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Did you watch today's training commander? I was a shotI hit Bismarck!...Hehe, am I very good!"
 Rodney_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Alright~! Even if you look at me with that kind of pitiful eyes, I can't help but perform the task. Come on, close your eyes... hee hee, wait for me to come back~!"
 Rodney_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hey! Look at your listless look. Would you like Miss Rodney to cheer for you?"
 Rodney_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Commander, you said that I have been in the port area for so long, have you improved?...Really?! How do you compare with your sister!...Oh! You are just perfunctory! Why? I'm serious!"
 Rodney_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "My sister is really amazing! Commander, I tell you that she often says something really cool. I will teach you something: England expects everyone to do their duties. How about it, isn't it cool! "
 Rodney_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Speaking of it, at first I just followed my sister's footsteps and came here, and then I gradually liked the feeling of hitting an opponent. And now, I have (blushing)... I hate it, do you have to say it? Will it be better with practical actions (to get closer)."
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_1:0 "Promise? Creed? Don't entrust your destiny to others, only yourself is the most reliable."
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_2:0 "Your Excellency worked hard today. How about a drink after work is over?"
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_3:0 "Please work hard, don't regret your inaction today!"
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_4:0 "The starry sky at night is like a deep and quiet seabed."
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_5:0 "I can often feel that there is a trace of...unspeakable sadness in your heart."
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_6:0 "...If only we could protect Hood and fight back then..."
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Please don't slack off any daily work. It is impossible to get rid of the hangover with a drink. When you encounter trouble, it is impossible to solve it because we pray to the sky... Is it a bit serious? Sorry, please let me be with you Let's start working."
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Maybe I am usually too serious, so are you afraid of me?...I don't want it, but I am even more afraid of the bad luck that does not know when it will come. You...maybe the only thing I can rely on Object."
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Until I was a bit naive, brave to a bit reckless... She obviously experienced that kind of despair, but she was much stronger than me. Did I lose?... Mature and steady... This is not a compliment to me. "
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Uh-um-my head hurts, I'm sorry... I worried you... ah? Did I sweat a lot?... You, you, you don't actually need to wipe it for me personally. Near (blushing)..."
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It would be great if all troubles could be solved with brute force...I never feared even the most powerful enemy, but this indescribable fear...unknown, really is the most terrifying?"
 PrinceofWales_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The moonlight is a little bleak... It's been a long time since I had a wine tasting together. Would you like to have a drink?"
 Nevada_TouchDialog_1:0 "Today's training...why, it feels not enough, Commander, can you add more training?"
 Nevada_TouchDialog_2:0 "There is no time for me to splurge. Now I only hope to make myself stronger and make up for the mistakes I made due to negligence in the past."
 Nevada_TouchDialog_3:0 "With such anti-aircraft firepower, I will never fear the sky anymore... One-on-one singles? That's a piece of cake!"
  Nevada_TouchDialog_4:0 "When the war is over, I will be useless? At that time, I want to go back to the blue ocean and see her again."
 Nevada_TouchDialog_5:0 "The port area at night is really fascinating, not to mention... Haha! The Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean are not as comfortable here!"
 Nevada_TouchDialog_6:0 "My footsteps are getting more and more unable to keep up with those outstanding juniors. Even so, I want to use the residual heat again and do something for them."
 Nevada_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ah
 Nevada_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Don't think that the gambler just surrendered his fate to God. In my game, there was no failure."
 Nevada_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Being with you is really the biggest gamble of my life, but it is also the gamble that I knew from the beginning to win. You guy, really an excellent companion, hahaha..."
 Nevada_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Whether the Russian roulette pistol has only one bullet or only one bullet removed, there is no difference between the two parties in the duel. Because there are only two endings, death and survival. Just like us Like a battle, to be honest, I'm a little tired..."
 Nevada_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hey, after the battle is over... I mean, if the battle is over, will you leave here?... Hahaha, I don't know why, I kind of want to stay here for a lifetime, if you want to, it would be... great NS."
 Nevada_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Listening to the evening bell, blowing the sea breeze, it's so pleasant... If she also... Haha, how about another glass?... Don't give me a beer. I'm going crazy if I don't let me have a beer at this time, hehe! "
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_1:0 "Fate is really a wonderful thing. She gave me a new life that should have disappeared, and I must be grateful and respond with anger..."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_2:0 "Nevada can't seem to accept that failure. Will the commander take care of her for me... I think I need to stay here more."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_3:0 "Whenever it rains and the sky is warm, the young wheat fragrant, and the air is sweet and clear~♫...Sorry, the nose is a bit sour for some reason."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_4:0 "The night is the most suitable for chasing the enemy...what, you said risk, haha, you can't win without this awareness."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_5:0 "War has turned people into beasts, and frustration has shattered our lives, but you alone have the power to change everything..."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_6:0 "Every night I sit next to you, with the one I love, watching the eagle, hovering in the blue sky~♬"
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Nevada is finally getting serious, and I will not fall behind. Commander, you are invited to be the referee for this game."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Killing is not an end, it's just a means. This, both you and me, need to be kept in mind at all times. In this way, even if one of us loses our way, let the other one save it …Huh, it seems to be a good plot."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Whenever it rains and the sky is warm, the wheat seedlings fragrant, the air is sweet and sweet~♫...sorry, the nose is a little sour for some reason"
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It seems that I haven't rested for a long time, my spirit has been tight, but if I'm by your side, I should...can relax completely..."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "That guy still likes to drink so much, has she forgotten how many stupid things she did after drinking too much?...well, just take it to accompany her and have a drink."
 Oklahoma_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Every night I sit next to you, with the one I love, look at the eagle, hovering in the blue sky~♬"
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_1:0 "Luck is also part of strength~"
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_2:0 "After the transformation, it is more powerful? Humph~ How come I just found out now that I won't be happy!"
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey~ The results of this expedition are quite good, and I am really good! Well, the commander also has a small part of the credit... a small part!"
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_4:0 "I... I don't just rely on luck, hard power is the key to victory!"
  AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_5:0 "If you need help, just say it, although I may not agree to it... Of course, if you ask me... you can still consider it!"
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_6:0 "What a good performance tonight, I just happened to have too many supper, so I will give you a little bit!"
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "How? This is the charm of an adult~Even you will fall at my feet~ Hahaha, I can praise me more-what is it! You suddenly laughed!? Ha I’ve been acting just now?! Stop this lady! Don’t run away!! "
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Kayo!! Stop the commander!! Oh! What are you doing! What a fool!! Whoops?! Why are you crying!? My sister was angry just now, so I didn't blame you for meaning! Be good~ After I have punished the commander, I will come and cook for you. Go back to the dormitory and wait for my sister, I will be back soon!"
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Good job, Veneto! Your outfit doesn't look like a decoration! Humph, Commander~ Where else can you go? The entire port area is under the control of this lady -Oh?! Kiss, kiss here!! You, you, you...I will spare you this time! But there will be no next time!! "
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Uhhhhh~Kayo, what do you want to eat? Despite the request, sister I am very happy, everything will satisfy you~ After all, I am a good understanding sister~ Ah! Do you want to challenge it? "Look up at the stars"! What London taught me recently~ eh? No? It sounds so cool... "
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "At night, it's dark everywhere, only here is the light. You didn't use this to target me on purpose! Do you want this lady to give in to you like this? Wow! Who will The lights are off!! But, damn it! It is subconscious to hold you, don't think too much about you, you, you!"
 AndreaDoria_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh...huh...um...meow? Meow...cat!!! Oscar?! Or ginger?! Why did you come here!! Commander! Callo! Come and save me! Oh ah ah!!! Don't come over!!!"
 Kongou_TouchDialog_1:0 "The product born through the tempering of time must have its uniqueness."
 Kongou_TouchDialog_2:0 "I like these homing pigeons, their relatives are cute~ the way they fly to eat, reminds me of the past."
 Kongou_TouchDialog_3:0 "Those submarines are so amazing, you can't see them wearing oxygen cylinders and other auxiliary tools, and they can stay on the bottom of the sea for so long. Ah? I just think it's funny, I don't like them, don't make a mistake! "
 Kongou_TouchDialog_4:0 "Um... These whiskeys look so high-end, will it be wasted if you drink them like this? Although the kid said to please me freely, but still a bit reluctant..."
 Kongou_TouchDialog_5:0 "From time to time, my muscles are sore, am I overworked? Hmm... it should be okay to steal laziness occasionally..."
 Kongou_TouchDialog_6:0 "Huh? Are you scared? Oh, I'm still wearing this. How about? Isn't it very imposing! The Noh mask I read from the doctor is still an evil face!"
 Kongou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I am used to life here now, and of course my habit of speaking has changed. You never find it interesting like before, do you? Hey...really..."
 Kongou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "When I left Country E, my classmates in the college gave me a tea brick, saying that it was to let me remember the taste of Country E. But I always forgot to drink...and I couldn't bear to drink it."
 Kongou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Are you going to have a glass of whiskey? I bought it from the doctor. I heard that it will enhance the femininity... I think I was probably fooled."
 Kongou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "...Training is really troublesome! You are so, give me more confidence! I want to help everyone, but I don’t have the doppelganger techniqueit hurts! Huh? How could I be here? Here?!"
 Kongou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "What are you looking for? I have already given that Noh mask to a serious little guy, and it feels more suitable for her. After all, the child’s eyes can emit red light, more like a "ghost" than me. "."
 Kongou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Who is the old antique! No one taught you to treat your seniors in awe?! "Predecessors" will do, don't add the word "old" in front!"
 Renown_TouchDialog_1:0 "Don't confess Nelson and me to the wrong like those rigid people from Country G."
 Renown_TouchDialog_2:0 "May the glory of the Royal Navy bless you forever."
 Renown_TouchDialog_3:0 "No one on the battlefield will pay attention to your past record. Only when you play to perfection every time can the enemy feel the real fear."
 Renown_TouchDialog_4:0 "You have been working hard recently. Here are some snacks I made for you. Please use it slowly. Let me help you complete the next work."
 Renown_TouchDialog_5:0 "Since I have assumed the glory of the Royal Navy, I will definitely protect this port area, other sisters, and...you."
 Renown_TouchDialog_6:0 "Whether it is God of War or glory, it is nothing but fleeting glory, but if I can, I only hope that such glory can stay longer."
 Renown_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The glory of the Royal Navy will not be borne by me alone from today. After all, I still have you by my side."
 Renown_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Today's afternoon tea is Earl Grey tea and cranberry scones. I wonder if you like it?"
  Renown_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The battle is relatively easy, after all, it would be nice to knock down the opponent. It's just that it takes some time to deal with the daily chores."
 Renown_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Have you finished your work? It's hard work, although I just came back, but the counterattack seems to have prepared a meal for us, let's enjoy it together."
 Renown_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Does the commander like stars? If you look up at the starry sky every night... Hey, Commander, your face is not very good, do you have any bad memories?"
 Renown_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh, Commander, today... Yeah, are you asleep? Hee hee, the appearance of sleeping in his arms is really different from when he was serious during the day...like a little cat."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_1:0 "Under the leadership of the Prince of Wales, the strength of the Z Fleet is getting better and better."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_2:0 "I also have to train hard to help my sister share the worries one day."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_3:0 "Although I often get sick due to physical reasons, it will not affect my work... Probably."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, you... have you come to see me? I'm just a little weak, it doesn't matter."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_5:0 "On the outside, my sister is always beautiful, but what kind of responsibilities bear the glory of the Royal Navy, maybe only my sister knows what it feels like."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_6:0 "Now I can share the worries for the commander, remembering that I didn't know anything when I first came to the port area, which caused you a lot of trouble...Thank you."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Master, what do you want to eat today? The counterattack has prepared some snacks for you. You eat first. The meal is not ready yet, so you have to wait a while!... Hee hee, as long as you master you wake up Time, you won’t be in a hurry."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Let’s start from your office. Although it is not guaranteed to cover everything, start cleaning little by little and you can always finish. Next is... ahem, don’t always stare at me, work hard, work oh !"
 Repulse_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Master!! I tell you! Sister sheshe praised me for progress today!!...Hey, how do you look at your disappointed expression? Are you not happy when I am progressing?"
 Repulse_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Is there any improvement in my level of making tea recently?...Although there is still a gap between the tea made with my sister, I will not give up. Whether it is fighting or living, I will not give up... Hee hee, though. It’s a little selfish, but it’s also to help my sister..."
 Repulse_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Want to go out for a walk tomorrow? Let me think about what I want to bring... Hee hee, just leave it to me, you just need to remember to bring me, and if you forget, I will be angry!"
 Repulse_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Ah...have you not rested yet? Or you woke up halfway?...Well, I can't sleep tonight, so I just want to wait for the sunrise here, if...if I can be with you...just... Better..."
 Alaska_TouchDialog_1:0 "I tried to remodel it. Although I encountered a lot of difficulties because I insisted on keeping the playing equipment, but now it looks good, isn't it?"
 Alaska_TouchDialog_2:0 "Hey... hey hey... audition! Ah-this equipment in Guam is not quite right, it seems that it must be maintained."
 Alaska_TouchDialog_3:0 "Although the missile launcher is installed, my main gun has never been removed, so it is okay for me to have a romantic gun fight with the enemy~!"
 Alaska_TouchDialog_4:0 "Come on, here are my tickets for tonight's concert. I have prepared a new song specially for this concert. Of course, the lyrics are Guam. She is a genius in this respect!"
 Alaska_TouchDialog_5:0 "The concert is to cheer up! Don't let me find anyone sitting on the seat, in the port area tonight, cheers are going to wake up every sleeping enemy!"
 Alaska_TouchDialog_6:0 "It's over. The empty concert is really quiet... At this time, there should be a "Nocturne in F minor"? This piano piece... How do you play it?"
 Alaska_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Music is my weapon, the missile chooses its own trajectory with the music... What a romantic way of fighting this is. What do you think?"
 Alaska_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Brass Knight, this little guy has a good name, will there be a Silver Knight in the future?...just kidding, I thought you would pick up my stalk."
 Alaska_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hey-I feel a little stiff, Commander, can I do a stretch with me?"
 Alaska_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "As far as music is concerned, words are flesh and blood, music is soul, and people are just a medium that visualizes them. People are singing, it is better to say that songs are guiding people."
 Alaska_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Don't listen to such intense music when you are tired. Although I like it very much, it will make your mind more unconscious. If your work ends soon, I can play it for you myself, but not now."
 Alaska_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Which tune do you want to listen to? The night is already late, so don't choose too intense tunes, otherwise, if you wake up Washington, who knows what will happen."
 Guam_TouchDialog_1:0 "You can't relax in your daily practice. My sister said that if you don't sing for three days, the god of music will leave you."
 Guam_TouchDialog_2:0 "Ahhhhh not enough
 Guam_TouchDialog_3:0 "I wrote a new song, do you want to listen to it? But after listening to it, I need to comment on it."
 Guam_TouchDialog_4:0 "I really envy a singer like my sister. She shouts loudly and sings as much as possible. I can't do it yet, it's a little bit close."
 Guam_TouchDialog_5:0 "Washington, did you bother you? Sorry, sorry, I will remind the Gothic Lion and sister."
 Guam_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sister, it's been a long time since I played an ensemble. Would you like to try it? I will let you see my progress."
 Guam_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "How about? Are my fans very enthusiastic?...Fortunately, fans in Missouri are called fanaticism. Once I went out with her, it was really like being a thief..."
 Guam_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Every fan is a treasure to me. And you are my most precious treasure."
 Guam_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "New song, what should I do? Commander, I take a leave today, I want to... go to the beach to relax and find some inspiration."
 Guam_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Are you free tonight? I have a small concert. You take good care of me on weekdays. Occasionally, I have to give you back."
 Guam_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "What's your evaluation of me?...Because of getting along day and night, there are more possibilities and a more rational evaluation."
 Guam_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Today is about to end, hoo-so tired, so tired, come, hug me back to sleep. I'm tired and can't walk anymore."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_1:0 "A momentary frustration is by no means an end. Analyze the mistakes, simulate the exercise, and wait for the time to counterattack."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_2:0 "Only after experiencing setbacks can you better move towards the front. Ah, I accidentally preached again. Too wordy is not a good thing."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_3:0 "Today's afternoon tea is specially made matcha for the younger generation~ eh? No, it cannot be taken away in a hip flask. No matter what the reason is."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_4:0 "Looking up at the stars like this, recalling what happened on this day, whether right or wrong, has passed away with the stars."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_5:0 "If you can take off at night, it will definitely help the battle. But in that way, how do those "children" land on the deck?"
 Akagi_TouchDialog_6:0 "What's the matter? Are you worried about the paperwork? I have to deal with so much... I just don't know how to spend this long night, so let me help."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Watching the twilight pass, does such a life really make sense? But with you, all of this makes sense. Haha, I want to be sentimental occasionally~"
 Akagi_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "What kind of experience is it to give everything to one person? But at this moment, I am experiencing this process. What the result is, it’s up to you to feel it~"
 Akagi_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "A pot of wine, a cup of tea. A love, a lifelong wish. No matter the world changes, no matter the vicissitudes of the world, I will always be by your side without any regrets."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The afterglow of the setting sun seems to be still in sight... Well, let’s start working at night. First of all, what do you want to eat? As long as it is a dish that can be called, I can probably prepare it for you. Or, Is it better as usual? Well, I understand."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "People have been afraid of the darkness from the beginning, and because of this, they have all kinds of behaviors to disperse the darkness. As for me, as long as you are by my side, I will never bow to this endless darkness. You, that’s My lighthouse."
 Akagi_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Can't help but want to preach, I really worry a little too much. After experiencing that, I always feel that everything is possible. In order to prevent those unknown events, I became a little nervous. Hehe, it's so funny, me like this."
 Kaga_TouchDialog_1:0 "Shaohua is white, but in a flash. Isn't life a big dream? Now that the dream wakes up, I understand-what this body can do. Without leaving regrets, this life will not be in vain. "
 Kaga_TouchDialog_2:0 "Don't be impatient. Don't let emotions interfere with the control of the game. If you don't pay attention, you will lose all your previous efforts-don't say "I'm sorry", you just need to do better."
  Kaga_TouchDialog_3:0 "A cup of strong tea is better than a hundred glasses of spirits. It numbs one's own body, with all harms but no benefit. Doesn't it sound like what I said? Haha, this hip flask hasn't been filled for a long time. Look, it's empty--"
 Kaga_TouchDialog_4:0 "Look at who this is? You told me to quit drinking, but you came here to steal and drink. What an insincere "little fox". Don't drink too much, I don't want to recite you-I haven't said anything yet Say... Sigh."
 Kaga_TouchDialog_5:0 "Um... Admiral? This girl is not a big problem, you don't need to worry. She is just a childlike innocence, and she can't help herself for a while. As a result, she looks like this. The chatter ends here, and my generation will not disturb you to enjoy the moon. It's elegant."
 Kaga_TouchDialog_6:0 "Are you still pretending to be asleep? It's really a clingy little "fox". If you have a tail, I am afraid that you will be wagging with joy now? It's not bad, it's better to let the doctor install a machine for you Are you awake? You haven't got to the dormitory yet, let's "sleep" a little longer."
 Kaga_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The stars in the sky seem to be telling each other's stories. Either sorrow or joy, weaving into this vast galaxy. Can the stories you and I describe also become a member of this vast galaxy Woolen cloth?"
 Kaga_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "A person's life is like the process of purifying dirty wine. Perplexity and sorrow have disappeared with the hustle and bustle of the past. A pot of fine wine, and you share the appreciation."
 Kaga_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Life is like a flat leaf boat. Only after being tortured in the vast ocean named "Destiny" can it shine brightly-this is the end of the nagging time. Do I need to add tea to you?"
 Kaga_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "This bamboo forest was originally our dojo. Since the girl moved in, in order not to disturb her, we have found an alternative place. Have you not seen it? That girl's hot look is more evil Ghosts are still scary."
 Kaga_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "What do you want to do? There is still a long time to come. Why don’t you use these eyes to find out? It’s more vivid and meaningful than the one thousand and one nights I said in dry language. ."
 Kaga_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Once, that azure-blue figure shrouded my heart all day long, like a nightmare. If I take a wrong step, I might also fall into the abyss. Now, the dream wakes up. I am me. This heart , Will never deteriorate."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_1:0 "Well, well, you are still talkative as always, how about sitting down and resting for a while? I've been so desperate already, so I won't say a few words occasionally..."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_2:0 "I also know that there is no room for swords in the current era, but as long as I swing it, my spirit and will will never rust. This is more important than honing sword skills."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_3:0 "Zuifeng and Ruihe have not grown much up to now, so I have given up on the leisurely life...what, considerate? Do you think I have that kind of personality?"
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_4:0 "Huh? You yawned so early? Eat some high-sugar snacks to keep your mind clear. This is what I learned from staying up late."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_5:0 "The clerical management is still a headache as always. It's obvious that the use of force on the battlefield is a no-brainer thing that is more suitable for me..."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_6:0 "Are you still working at this time? I didn't expect to be better than me. If Ruifeng sees it, we will both have to take a slap in the face."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Actually, I don’t understand until now. Where does a marginal figure who has passed by and has no self-motivated like me make you look at it? Ah, is that so? I'm sorry, haha..."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I also gradually like this feeling of fulfillment, how can I say it? Being relied on and needed is really refreshing. Not only fighting with the children, but also by your side..."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "This is today's combat layout, please have a look. I am also in the attack sequence. If I changed to the previous words, I must have grumbled again, ah ha ha."
  Shouhou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Hey, this is the sake that I just bought. It tastes great. In order to avoid the sight of some alcoholics, I have been hiding in the hangar and finally took it out. So, don’t accompany me for a few drinks NS?"
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I think it's time to teach you a few kendo moves. Even if you don't want to be proficient, you can also make your meridians flexible and thinking more agile. Of course, I am a strict instructor."
 Shouhou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Can't do this anymore! In the current game, there are too many payment traps to lure the purchase of items, but I can't help but pay, ooh, I still lost to it."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_1:0 "Recently, there have been more and more opportunities for joint exercises. After watching the fighting postures of the seniors up close, I understood many of my shortcomings. The goal in the future is to make up for these shortcomings and try to catch up with the seniors. NS."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_2:0 "In order to cooperate with Senior Zuihou, I also painted a camouflage color. This is just the beginning. There is still a long way to go to become her reliable wing. Therefore, I can't relax for a moment."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_3:0 "Insufficient equipment, just use experience to make up. If you lack experience, use hard work to make up. You can always find a solution, but if you don’t do anything, you can’t do anything."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's Kiso, what can I do at this late hour? Try... Sorry, this sword is only swung for one person. Please allow me to use a bamboo knife instead. Maybe this can't make you happy, please bear with me."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_5:0 "How many times have I said, "Don't play the handheld in the dark place, why can't you remember at all... Do you want to be blind and wear blindfolds on both eyes? Are you afraid? Don't go to rest soon."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_6:0 "The admiral...? Why are you here? Waiting for me...? Sorry, I'm so addicted to training that you stayed up with you too. Let's go back, it's not too late now, take a good rest In order to welcome the sunrise tomorrow."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I'm wondering, should I also teach you some basic swordsmanship. With one more technique, your reputation among colleagues will be higher. How? Do you want to try?"
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Since you have decided, don't blame my teachings for being too harsh. I came here in the same way, so I can stand by your side and wave the sword for you. Okay, the chat time is over-take Raise the sword!"
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "When I am on a mission, you can ask Tianlong for advice. Her swordsmanship is above me, and she usually just runs on expeditions, which is too awkward."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Does it feel particularly good to sweat? It's better than sitting in an office. But you still have business to deal with, I won't bother you, see you later."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Senior Ruihe, I have completed today's training according to your requirements. Yes, I have worked hard for you. I have a request...Could you take the liberty to ask you to have a drill with me? One to one. I want to know my limits."
 Zuihou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "...Have I fainted? Thank you for taking care of me, Senior Xianghe. I didn't expect that the gap would be so obvious. No, Senior Ruihe was not wrong, it was because I overestimated what I could bear. Ability. Anyway, thank her for me."
 Argus_TouchDialog_1:0 "Called back here again, I will definitely be able to play a bigger role. Commander, you have to be optimistic."
 Argus_TouchDialog_2:0 "Hey! If the ladies of the aircraft carrier think that I can only teach, that would be a big mistake. Let me show you my true strength."
 Argus_TouchDialog_3:0 "The commander is here, do you want to participate in the training together? I have special training for you as a commander~"
 Argus_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, tonight’s course is the history of the development of aircraft carriers. Listen carefully and don’t lose your mind~"
 Argus_TouchDialog_5:0 "Should we consider letting the aircraft carrier ladies experience the night battle? But for me... it's still too difficult."
 Argus_TouchDialog_6:0 "Preparing training content every day is actually the biggest exercise for yourself."
 Argus_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Partners should accompany each other. Otherwise, how can we reflect our relationship? Are you right?... So please get up quickly and accompany me to watch the training of the aircraft carrier ladies."
 Argus_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hmm~ I didn't expect it, I will appear at this time. As a teacher, I am not only training aircraft carrier ladies, but I will not forget you~ Don't want to be lazy~"
 Argus_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Let’s give you a holiday today, so you can have a good rest without worrying about work...hehe, but at the same time (holding your hands) as a partner, you can’t leave me alone!"
 Argus_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Huh-I can finally take a break at night. Compared to training the aircraft carrier ladies, whatever I do with you can make me feel relaxed~"
 Argus_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Heymaybe a little unwilling, although I can teach them, but I don’t have enough strength to play a role on the battlefield... Otherwise, I can do more for you, hehe, Some ashamed to say..."
 Argus_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "When I first met, I called myself old to put on airs, but now I am often taught like that...oh, what should I do, if I continue like this, one day I will be called grandma... ah, ah, shameful NS!"
 Langley_TouchDialog_1:0 "Although I don't seem to be conspicuous, people who ignore me will pay a heavy price."
  Langley_TouchDialog_2:0 "As the "Number One", you can't fall behind everyone. Every step forward, you must actually enrich yourself."
 Langley_TouchDialog_3:0 "The scenery of the West Coast is so beautiful. If you have the opportunity, you must take the commander to take a look."
 Langley_TouchDialog_4:0 "I really miss the time when I was able to use my strength at will..."
 Langley_TouchDialog_5:0 "There are always ignorant young people who want to come and violate the port area, but they can't escape my eyes."
 Langley_TouchDialog_6:0 "The Coral Sea... is really a place that I don't want to remember."

 Ranger_TouchDialog_1:0 "The difference between a regular aircraft carrier and a light aircraft carrier? I think it should be the amount of aircraft. But hum, commander, where are you looking?"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_2:0 "I heard that the younger generations are showing their great power on the other side of the sea, pitifully, I can only beat soy sauce here...Of course I will cheer you on!"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_3:0 "Come on today too!"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_4:0 "Ha...a bit tired...but I can work harder! Come on!"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_5:0 "In addition to cheering everyone, I can also help you do more things, so happy!"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_6:0 "Work hard! I will try my best to help you, but don't let it go!"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hehe~ The assaulter is here to wake you up. Would you like a cup of hot milk? Or do you want a kiss full of love?"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The little guys flying all over the sky are so cute, Commander, would you like to touch it too? You are very good~"
  Ranger_TouchDialog_oathed_3: 0 "Awu - and so finally came a day for rest, did not think the commander is still only think of hanging this boring thing in the harbor ... I have an idea, we will let this become stroll It's fun... (whispering) As long as you hold me, hehe~"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "(Whispering) It's charming to work hard... Let me take a photo secretly... Ah, I was found, hehe."
 Ranger_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, do you think your ears are uncomfortable? Come on, lie on my lap, let me have a check on you, hehe, Miss Raider will be very gentle!"
 Ranger_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Although the assailant is a bit stupid and not excellent, but I have won your heart. This should be a unique record, hehe, don't you think?"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_1:0 "Don't be too intoxicated in rest, new battles will come at any time, always keep your best condition.\n"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_2:0 "If you have the spare time to stare at me, how about supervising other people's exercises? (sighs) It's useless to be stupid. Please take your job seriously, Commander."
 Lexington_TouchDialog_3:0 "Have you seen Saratoga? Hey, this kid ran away while I didn't pay attention, so he could take the rest of the course instead of the Commander?"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_4:0 "The weather is pretty good now, do you want to go out and relax like before?"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_5:0 "It seems to be very annoying at work recently. I have prepared some desserts for you. Come, tell me?"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_6:0 "It's bad for your health to stay up late, so please rest early."
 Lexington_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The wind is a bit big today, remember to add more clothes, ah... By the way, I made some food for you. If you are hungry, remember to eat, but don’t leave it~"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hehe, here-the commander made a mistake! Then punish it a little, come on, get your head out~"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It's weird, where's my headwear... Commander, have you seen... Hey, what are you laughing at? You really are (kiss)... No~ I found it in your pocket, and it was you on purpose. Hide it, little villain~!"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I don't know when it became a habit to go home with you holding hands... Hey, why is your face red?"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "What do you want to eat tonight? No matter what kind of dish, I have the confidence to make it~!"
 Lexington_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh?...Have you had a nightmare again? Don't be afraid, I'm right by your side, I won't go anywhere... Look at you, your forehead is sweating, don't move, I'll wipe it for you."
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_1:0 "I won't lose to my sister... My sister can do it, so can I! I will prove it to everyone!"
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_2:0 "I'm a little bit out of enthusiasm today... However, I still can't slack off. You have to get up and continue training... Commander, you also have to work hard."
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_3:0 "It's a reassuring thing to travel with Princeton."
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_4:0 "If the plane can be released at night, it will be able to fight the enemy more effectively."
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_5:0 "Is the commander tired? Saratoga is with you tonight~"
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_6:0 "I have always been under the protection of my sister...If I can grow faster, I can fight alongside her. In this way, she can also relax..."
  Saratoga_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey! Guess who I am?...Is it Lexington or Saratoga?...Hey, why do you always get your guess? My eyes are covered, so I should not see the collar... "
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Although it’s a bit late, it’s not too late to let you know my true strength in Saratoga, right?... Hee hee, don’t just have your sister in your eyes and forget me! Including you, Commander official."
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It's dawn, it's time to get up and train... I really don't want to get up... Hey, it turns out that the commander sleeps so sweetly every day, hehe, let me draw a little panda here..."
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Hehe, I haven’t been out for a walk with you for a long time...Ah, am I too busy?...Suddenly become harder? Hey, I didn’t even notice...then, you think this change is Is it good or not?"
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It seems that the time with you is passing extremely fast, hehe, can you teach me how to deal with these files?... Great, Saratoga can help you too."
 Saratoga_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh-if I can still be the Saratoga hiding under my sister's arms, but I don't want my sister to be harmed anymore, hehe... Commander, you will also support me, right? "
 Takao_TouchDialog_1:0 "Speaking of the advantages, naturally it is the overwhelming firepower and the castle-like bridge. On the contrary, once it catches fire, it will cause a headache..."
 Takao_TouchDialog_2:0 "In the case of an air attack... should I say whether I am not good at it or will accidentally hurt... No, no, just treat me as not good at it, that's good."
 Takao_TouchDialog_3:0 "Cooking is also one of my skills. Hmm... I don't know if it will suit your appetite."
 Takao_TouchDialog_4:0 "The day and night alternate, and the mood changes with it. Well, it's unspeakably refreshing."
 Takao_TouchDialog_5:0 "Night patrol is also one of the duties of the secretary ship, thenI'm leaving."
 Takao_TouchDialog_6:0 "With the attitude of giving it a try, I made a supper...If you don't like it, can you give it a try?"
 Takao_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Take advantage of the time and do more meaningful things. For example-helping the destroyer carry the cargo. After all, they also receive a lot of care from them on weekdays, and they have to return a gift."
 Takao_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Accumulate a lot of experience to make delicious dishes. Don't look at me being busy with official duties, but I also practice in private. As long as it is a famous dish, I can cook it for you. This is no joke. ,Please trust me."
 Takao_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "That's it, what else do you need? Haha, I've said it's not a joke, you look unbelievable. If you say it more seriously, don't look down on people."
 Takao_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I feel uncomfortable when I am idle. What's wrong with me... Well, what can I do. Admiral, is there anything you can do for me? Please feel free to bring it up. You are welcome."
 Takao_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Treating tenderly...? How to treat tenderly? I think the relationship between us should be this kind of feeling? Huh? These strange terms are really hard to understand, please forgive me. "
 Takao_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Sister, why do you look uncomfortable? Is the croquette unappetizing? It's strange, you still ate very happily at noon. Admiral, I will leave for a while and take this child to the infirmary. ."
 Atago_TouchDialog_1:0 "Beautiful things are also a burden...Well, I'm talking about bridges."
 Atago_TouchDialog_2:0 "Kaohsiung's cooking skills are also divided into "day and night", you must not eat what she makes at night."
 Atago_TouchDialog_3:0 "Have a humble heart at all times, so that great things can be accomplished. Ah, am I a bit verbose?"
  Atago_TouchDialog_4:0 "Next is the time for the adults, the destroyers go back to sleep. The special driver over there, stop for me!"
 Atago_TouchDialog_5:0 "It's not a good thing to stay up late, even if it's work, you have to be able to stop. Your health is the first."
 Atago_TouchDialog_6:0 "Why is the kitchen light still on at so late? Oops! The admiral is in the office alone!"
 Atago_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Do you want to behave like a child, Admiral? Ha, that's really the right person. My arms are warm, but you must remember that you will get a whip after eating "candy"."
 Atago_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Strict enough to scare people, will you overdo it a little bit? But it's hard to imagine how approachable I am... well, I can't think of it myself. Alas... so be it."
 Atago_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Attention, Admiral. Now let me teach you how to ensure your own safety. For example, when you hear bizarre noises while working, please don’t hesitate to find a shelter immediately. Take precautions, even in the port area. It cannot be said to be 100% safe."
 Atago_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Some things are inconspicuous on weekdays, but in fact they can change the situation of the battle. For example, the pie in front of you, really, don’t eat it. I will send someone to deal with it, absolutely Don't touch it."
 Atago_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Tsk, lethality is getting stronger and stronger, should I praise you Kaohsiung sister... What kind of principle is this, I really can’t understand. Ah, Maya, have you brought Niaohai here? Okay, follow me Come."
 Atago_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It’s great to be alive, don’t you think so? Admiral? Just stopped in time before the ghost gate closed. The crisis is over, you can enjoy your rest time after you finish your work. Please allow me To retire first, I have to observe my sister's condition."
 Maya_TouchDialog_1:0 "It's just a turret dismantled, no need to make a fuss. In exchange, it is a treasure that cannot be compensated with conventional firepower."
 Maya_TouchDialog_2:0 "The bridge has also been specially modified, which can somewhat reduce the chain reaction after a fire...probably...of course."
 Maya_TouchDialog_3:0 "The elder sister's cooking skills are just like time and minutes. Day is like nectar, night is like...this memory, let me keep it in the dust..."
 Maya_TouchDialog_4:0 "Brilliant Galaxy, I really want to be in my arms...what? Is it an excessive dream?"
 Maya_TouchDialog_5:0 "Your own work should be done by yourself. Admiral, please lead by example."
 Maya_TouchDialog_6:0 "Second sister? Is there anything going on here? What?! Big sister, is she doing supper again?!"

  Choukai_TouchDialog_1:0 "That group of destroyers called me "Niaohai Mage" secretly! Admiral, do I look like a mage? Really, can I still summon a tornado?"
 Choukai_TouchDialog_2:0 "The carrier-based aircraft is really a headache... At this time, I have to rely on Sister Mayer's assistance."
 Choukai_TouchDialog_3:0 "The location of the flagship... in any case, leave it to me! Your expectations, I will live up to it!"
 Choukai_TouchDialog_4:0 "As long as the searchlight is used properly, it can be more than a hundred times more effective. This is my personal experience, not a joke."
 Choukai_TouchDialog_5:0 "What happened in the end...I don't know. Everything was swallowed by the sea and returned to its original state."
 Choukai_TouchDialog_6:0 "The so-called "disaster" is exactly the situation at the moment... Why... I want to eat the things made by Sister Kaohsiung..."

 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hum, aren't you afraid? Let's continue. I tell you, no matter how many times you come, I will beat you upright!"
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_2:0 "I am not feeling well today. I had to ask Blücher to help me complete the task. I hope she can complete it smoothly."
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_3:0 "When the training is over, I will find Sister Bismarck and the others for a drink."
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_4:0 "Are you still working on the files? Cut, reallyit's boring! Why don't you come and have a drink with me?"
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_5:0 "Strong and weak are never determined by equipment and strength. Since fighting her, I understand this sentence more and more."
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sir, let me tell you that Blücher is great, especially...ah, no, she's chasing me!"
  AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Oh, every day I’m nagging, I’ll pay attention next time. How about this...every time I make a mistake in the future, I will allow you...hehe, would you expect me to make a mistake? Don’t be angry , Good~"
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Bullying the weak? No, no, sir, you really don't understand me. I am not the kind of bullying them for fun, but because of their resistance I make me happy!"
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hey! Firefly, you really have made a lot of progress! But...huh, this is the only way to defeat me, is your determination only this level? Ah-! Pain... Haha, this is just the truth! "
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Sir, you said... When did Prince Eugen become so strong? She said she wanted to protect her, but now she rushed to the front of the team to protect us... Haha, this is also my sister’s troubles. Woolen cloth!"
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "There is a small cocktail party in the bar tonight, do you want to go with me? Hehe~ You are so dumb, you will be scared when you go in, you have to wear a blindfold... just kidding, pull me Your hand is fine, don’t get lost!"
 AdmiralHipper_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "This little doll, huh-just to remind myself that carelessness will inevitably lead to failure. Actually, I would almost lose to this guy in the exercise field. Since then, I dare not underestimate any enemy. Human. The power is really immeasurable..."
 Blücher_TouchDialog_1:0 "This new type of ship outfit is simply perfect equipment for me."
 Blücher_TouchDialog_2:0 "Hippel has changed a bit since that battle. Although I can't tell what it is,...it seems to be a lot gentler, of course, except in some cases."
 Blücher_TouchDialog_3:0 "Sir, I am going out to complete my task now, don't miss me, I will be back soon."
 Blücher_TouchDialog_4:0 "Why did you come back so late? It's not a big deal, it's just that Hipper was a little uncomfortable, so I helped her perform a task. If the sir has time to care about me... it's better to care about her."
 Blücher_TouchDialog_5:0 "Did Emden just leave? I am really worried about her. She is not good at fighting, but she often has to rush to the front line. It must be very hard."
 Blücher_TouchDialog_6:0 "Hey, Hipper! Stop! Your hand just now...ahhhh, don't run!"
 Blücher_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Huh...Occasionally, it is a headache to get some urgent tasks to go out in the morning, so hurry up and find something to eat. After all, the chief is not here...hmm? The soup in the pot...is the chief left? Really careful? Guy."
 Blücher_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Confidence is the first step to success, so the sir also asks you to be more confident. Even if you play with me for a day today, it shouldn't delay any work, right?"
 Blücher_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Prince Eugen has become so strong since he regained his confidence. He was just a shy little sister...hehe, it seems that the mentality is very important!"
 Blücher_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Relax, sir, don't think everyone can be as good as you, for this, I am very confident!"
 Blücher_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "In fact, two days ago, I took Hipper's attention and measured her figure quietly and quietly. Do you want to hear it? But in return, you, you want to forget me..."
 Blücher_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Hippel likes drinking very much. He always says that drinking can forget the troubles, but why not just shoot to solve the root of the troubles? That will come faster."
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_1:0 "(Call)... Eugen will protect everyone... "
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_2:0 "Now I can protect everyone very well. So, I will work hard!"
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_3:0 "Now I will not hesitate anymore."
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_4:0 "These shields are proof of my determination."
  PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sir, with my protection, please rest assured to sleep."
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_6:0 "Well, I will never make a mistake again..."
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "(Whispering) Ah-is the sir watching?... Then, let me block all attacks for you!"
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I am not confused anymore... as long as you are still by my side."
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Let me practice for a while, maybe, I can make the most delicious dishes!"
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Hipper often said that Blücher was very predictable, but I... did I lose? Would you care?"
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "This is Blümchenkaffee made by myself. I wonder if you would like it..."
 PrinzEugen_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Toast...Although it's just the simplest variety, I hope it can be successful this time...Ah! Will it be too good to say such a big talk for the first time..."
 Wichita_TouchDialog_1:0 "Whether it is firepower or other competitions, I will not lose to others!"
 Wichita_TouchDialog_2:0 "On the battlefield, I only need to focus on artillery suppression, and leave the defense and torpedo attacks to my teammates!"
 Wichita_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey, Commander, I look good today. Why not train with me here."
 Wichita_TouchDialog_4:0 "This is an overweight bomb! Don't underestimate this baby, it is very powerful."
 Wichita_TouchDialog_5:0 "Although the main gun is powerful, the attack distance is still a flaw. If there is a weapon that can fly to the enemy like an airplane and attack it, it would be great."
 Wichita_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, although I am not sleepy, you have been busy for a day. It will be better to take a good rest and raise your energy."
 Wichita_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The artillery suppression-completed! Hey, this time it succeeded... However, it is too troublesome to carry out artillery suppression in every battle. Commander, is there no way to directly locate the enemy and suppress it? "
 Wichita_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Playing against aircraft carriers...Although I haven't thought about it, it will be fun, haha...After all, they are the overlords of the air. It is difficult for me to get close intact, but once I get close, that's my domain!"
 Wichita_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "How boring if everything is planned, it's like...Do you know that I will kiss you next second?"
 Wichita_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Miss Essex's Bell is really amazing. I lost my way on the battlefield last time, but it took the initiative to show me the way and let me discover the enemy's supply fleet and wiped it out in one breath. It's really enjoyable, haha! "
 Wichita_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "When the firepower is suppressed, you must not miss it. Just like love to you, you must hit the bullseye perfectly in every sentence, isn't it, dear?"
 Wichita_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Just like in the movie, the unrestrained girl and her beloved depend on each other to watch the waves rise and fall on the sea. At this time...cough cough, do I need to say what to do at this time?"
 Quincy_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hmph, I can't just be an idol, I have to work hard to prove to everyone that I am strong!"
 Quincy_TouchDialog_2:0 "Shhh...if you see my sister, just say you didn't see me~ Commander is the best!"
 Quincy_TouchDialog_3:0 "...I'm so hungry, so tired... But I have to train for a while, otherwise...it really can't compare to other sisters!"
 Quincy_TouchDialog_4:0 "Although there is a risk of hitting friendly forces if you open fire rashly at night, if you hesitate because of this, you will be in danger... So... well, Quincy knows what to do. Thank you, Commander."
  Quincy_TouchDialog_5:0 "Kun...Kun...Quincy?! Ah, Commander, I didn't fall asleep!"
 Quincy_TouchDialog_6:0 "The commander and the sisters work hard every day, and they have to take care of me who is a little stupid, but I also want to take on some responsibilities to protect everyone, if there is a chance..."
 Quincy_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Don't feed Quincy to strange things! Quincy won't be fooled anymore!"
 Quincy_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Don't think of me as a kid! Quincy is not a kid! Humph~!...Woo, Commander, do you have anything to eat? After training till now, Quincy is hungry..."
 Quincy_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Quincy is going to eat ice cream at noon today, do you want the commander to come together~!"
 Quincy_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The commander is still busy? Can you give Quincy a little rest on your lap? I'm a little tired today and won't disturb you...whoop..."
 Quincy_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Quincy sometimes accidentally gets into trouble, but I also try to make myself stronger... Why does the commander always touch my head! No, I also want to touch the commander's head... Don't run!"
 Quincy_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Commander, can you teach me how to do these things? Quincy can help you in the future..."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_1:0 "The management of the port area needs to keep pace with the times. There is no benefit in sticking to the old rules."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_2:0 "The destroyers are really energetic, and they are not tired from the expedition. Well, I like children like this."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_3:0 "Waving in your hand is an item that can protect everyone. This power will only be used for protection."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_4:0 "Admiral, please take your work seriously. Your words and deeds are benchmarks in the port area, so don't make mistakes."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_5:0 "A proper rest is also essential. Well, go to the candy store and buy some snacks, just to bring some for those children."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_6:0 "Oh~Admiral, I have some snacks from the destroyers. Would you like to have some?"
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "This is the end of today's training. You can go back. Ah, is it a snack for me? Good boy, thank you. Well, I am very happy. After all, it is a snack made by my favorite disciple. ."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Always receive gifts from children, I can’t put them in the room anymore. Can you allow me to put some in your office? A small gift contains their love~"
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Stick to form, and limit one's own heart. Anyone has had this experience. When will the suppressed self break through the shackles and bloom beautiful flowers?"
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Thoughts are what pushes people forward, and what drives the world is economy."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "You look tired, do you really don’t need to take a break? So... Since you’ve said so, then I can’t just stand by. It’s not only the duty of a secretary ship, but also more. As your partner-I will do my best to help you."
 Tenryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Who am I? Which path should I choose? The answer to this kind of question can only be realized by pushing myself into a desperate state and reaching the state of ecstasy."
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_1:0 "As the saying goes, "a long stream of water" should be the same with resources. If you are too lavish, you will suffer in the end, but the admiral yourself."
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_2:0 "Well, the expedition group has returned. The next is the expedition group 2, and it is estimated that there is still time to return to Hong Kong"
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_3:0 "During the expedition, we can always find a lot of interesting gadgets. For example, this small searchlight can emit a beam of light with just a few shakes. Well, it can come in handy at night."
  Tatsuta_TouchDialog_4:0 "Alright, alright, go to bed. If you stay up late, be careful not to grow too long~ Ah, this is not the admiral, are you on the way to patrol? Just let me join in~"
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_5:0 "Slash-call, take a break. I don't have time to practice during the day. I hope that the skills will not be unfamiliar. Otherwise, the Tianlong will get angry, it will be uncomfortable..."
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_6:0 "Well, let's try the searchlight that I picked up... It's a strong beam-Huh? Where did the cat come from... That's it, it can be used to make a cat look like."
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "That child's savvy is a bit beyond the scope of destroyers. Although he has only learned some of the fur of Iaizhan, the speed is already faster than I was before. I am really happy for her."
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hmm...I’m finished, what do I do next? Hey Admiral, you came back just right, can you accompany me to buy some sweets? It’s a snack for those kids, if you have something you want You can also buy everything together~ but you still have to spend your own money~"
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I once studied under Weisheng Liumen for a period of time. It is really a great skill. With careful concentration, with my own hands, I fill this "world" in a small vase. Heaven and earth , People, one whole."
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The admiral is still working hard...Fry some tempura to reward the admiral~ Hmm? Where did the peeled shrimp go? Shouldn't... these gluttonous cats, please pray not to be caught by me... "
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I found that your time concept is very weak. It's so late. Don't you feel sleepy? Although it is a good thing to work hard, you should also pay attention to your body... Well, it's just like cats that like to roam at night ..."
 Tatsuta_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I am obsessed with the deeds left by her predecessors, and spurring herself to become that kind of person, is it good or bad? At least, she has worked hard to change and got rid of the gloom of the past. Isn't that all right? ~"
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_1:0 "My current posture is the result of the release of the huge potential of our ball mill type."
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_2:0 "The ninety-three oxygen torpedo...the equipment you dream of is now fully loaded. But then again, this is actually quite dangerous. If you are hit by a shell, you can't solve it... "
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_3:0 "If she were there, she would definitely be surprised by how I look now. Haha, this has been the case since I was a child, but she is obviously an older sister but she doesn't get enough attention."
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_4:0 "On such a night, spraying a wave of torpedoes on the surface of the sea and waiting for the hapless bait is also a good entertainment~ That said, I haven't tried it once. These oxygen torpedoes are precious treasures, you can't just do it. Use it."
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_5:0 "We...Huh? Why are you here?"
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_6:0 "The postures of those destroyers when they were struck by lightning are so unpretentious. How did they pass the test when they were trained? I will teach them by myself when I find an opportunity. Lightning strikes are not simply launching torpedoes! "
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I'm so tired that I don't want to move... I said, I kept hanging on me before, but now I leave Hong Kong frequently... Admiral, you are the devil..."
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Once, resting time was the most boring pastime, but now it is like a handful of nectar in the desert... This gap is too big, I can't accept it..."
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I was assigned to a separate ninth team with her. To be honest, I always feel a lot of burden on my shoulders. But even if I am tired and confused, it is better to be idle than before. "
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "When I happened to pass by the destroyer’s dormitory once, I saw a child playing mahjong there. At that time, I was interested in playing mahjong, but she never touched mahjong again. Thinking about it now, I will. I won't overdo it..."
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "When the power you have reaches the top, you lose motivation. No one can surpass you, there is no enemy that can deal with it seriously, everything loses its color. Ah~ I want to become an aircraft carrier~ "
 Kitakami_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I thought about it later. Those kids are more suitable for the training methods of the Mines. My methods are a bit too extreme, maybe it will ruin them. "Teach them in accordance with their aptitude"-probably that's it."
 oui_TouchDialog_1:0 "After such a long time, you can still remember that we came. It makes me happy. You weren't complimenting you just now, you should be able to see it? The chat ends here. If there is no task, you Please go back."
 oui_TouchDialog_2:0 ""Lance" is the name of this sword, and also another name for the Type 93 oxygen torpedo. They are our trusted companions."
 oui_TouchDialog_3:0 "The escort of the wing ships is also very important. Don't forget, it is your duty to allocate team members reasonably."
 oui_TouchDialog_4:0 "She must have had the outrageous idea of ​​projecting the "spear" all at once. Of course, these torpedoes are precious treasures in the port area and cannot be chaotic with her temper."
 oui_TouchDialog_5:0 "Although she always likes Mai Tai, she also likes me in her heart. She wants to see her soon. Family reunion is even happier than getting the results."
  oui_TouchDialog_6:0 "If you want to be a member of the mine team, you must have a heart that contains the "water mine soul". Only by sticking to the "water mine soul" can you be considered an elite fighter."
 oui_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Successfully ushered in the transformation, followed by a large number of demand for attack. I had expected this a long time ago, but she has been leisurely for so long, and suddenly she must have difficulty adapting to the high-intensity work. Hope she can Hurry up and adjust the state."
 oui_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The ninth team has the same mind. We only need a glance to understand each other's thoughts. This is not bragging. This tacit understanding has long been engraved in the blood."
 oui_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "This sword was specially made by a friend. It not only has the characteristics of a sword, but also has other functions. But... she seems to have forgotten to give me the instructions... It seems that I have to explore it myself."
 oui_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Some people have been blessed by gods since they were born, right?"
 oui_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "She must have complained to me many times secretly... I, too, always like to say that she is not in front of you. This is probably not straightforward performance... I am a little embarrassed to tell you this... "
 oui_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "This is a lunch box prepared for her. According to her temperament, she will forget to prepare it again, and then she will act like a baby with me crying. Although her appearance is very fascinating, you can't deliberately bully her~ Yours and I are ready too, remember to eat it hot~"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_1:0 "How about it~ this new feeling! Humph, I can praise me any way you want~"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_2:0 "This is not a tray! If you think so, do you think of this single cannon as ice cream? Hey~you want to try it? The taste of this~"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_3:0 "It's a rare modification, and I feel that I haven't changed much? But it's not a good thing to keep your heart...cough cough, can't you praise others? Admiral, you wooden head!"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_4:0 "With the addition of an anti-aircraft machine gun, air defense is no longer a weak point! Haha...that's really good. But I'm still good at anti-submarine! This is true!"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_5:0 "Whhhhh, the anti-submarine operation is even more troublesome than the air, you must always stare at the information from the sonar and then set the attack direction... let me sleep for a while--"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_6:0 "Hey? Hey? Is it morning?! What, it turned out to be in the admiral's office. So good night-it hurts! It hurts! You said, don't grab my face!"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Peach~Are you playing peekaboo with your sister again? Hey, my sister will find you right here! Huh? Why are you?"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Although it is strange to say it by myself... but these anti-aircraft machine guns are a little in the way, don't you think that? The actual effect is so pitiful..."
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I finally bought what I wanted~ It's not in vain that I have been working for so long~ Hmm, "The hard work pays off!"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "You little ghosts, don't hide anymore! If this continues, I will throw explosive thunder to "enter" you!"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Master...ah no, admiral! I almost thought I was still working in the shop...no, don't care! Compared to this, do you have something to eat? I'll do it right away!"
 Isuzu_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Ah... I want to take a hot spring... My shoulders are sore, my body is weak, I'm about to crash... I don't want to work anymore..."
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_1:0 "I really want to go to the laboratory to continue research... Admiral, how long will I stay here?"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_2:0 "The circuit here still needs-oh, it's the admiral. Because it's too boring, I will continue to study here, there should be no problem, right?"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_3:0 "The speed has been affected by so many high-tech weapons...Ah, no! I don't want to abandon them anyway!"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_4:0 "I have been specially strengthened for air defense, and even the flies in the sky can't escape my eyes."
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_5:0 "Two different powers can complement each other. My invention illustrates this very well!"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_6:0 "If you can, please call me "Doctor", so that it has the atmosphere of a researcher, isn't it~ Haha, please, please~"
  Yuubari_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "According to your situation, I have made improvements to these capsules. Generally speaking, they have a "flavor". For example, this yellow one is banana flavor~ how about it? Would you like to try it?"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "No, no, no, how many times have I said that I am a scientist and not a repairman! Please find someone else if the equipment is broken, but if you want to add some new "features", I welcome you anytime~"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Oh, let me catch it. Little confused with glasses~ A trap I prepared specially for you! You stole the last "firecracker", right? Tell me honestly, otherwise I will use you to experiment with Veritaserum Up~"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Weird... I always feel that I have forgotten something? I can't remember it even if I think about it. It means that the brain judged that it is "not important"? So let's do the work in front of you~"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "If I can, I really don’t want to go back to the dormitory. There are piles of debris everywhere, and there is no place to stay. Ah, but it’s my own habit. It’s not comfortable to see a spacious place~"
 Yuubari_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I am not interested in expeditions, it is more interesting in the laboratory. But, if there are materials that are worth collecting by myself, it is not impossible to try it~"
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_1:0 "As a soldier, you should move forward. Any moment of hesitation will let the opportunity slip away."
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_2:0 "Senior Bismarck's combat ability is worthy of appreciation, but it is better to learn to conceal yourself if you face a strong enemy in combat."
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_3:0 "Seeing new and strange things is a great help to the growth of one's own experience."
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_4:0 "Take a good rest in peace. If it's an emergency, maybe it's a luxury to sleep in your own clothes."
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_5:0 "The starry sky turns out to be so beautiful... This is the first time I feel this way."
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_6:0 "Clerk...not very good at dealing with these..."
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Elite fighters should have eagle-like gazes! Just a sweep can make the enemy fearful! Phew~ it sounds very handsome!"
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "There is no other guy in the exercise field who can compete with me. No, I won't fight with guys of different ships, that's called "bullying"; as for who is bullying who, hehe~"
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sir, what are you looking at standing here? Tsk... where is a flock of skuas coming from here. Are these bad-hearted birds coming to grab someone else's territory again? Ah, it's really unpleasant!"
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Potatoes can be eaten as long as they are cooked in water and dipped in salt. All other methods are a waste of time. Hey! I said so, what are you doing with slices? Stop it!"
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Practical combat is the touchstone to test the professionalism of a soldier. As for you, your ability to develop this port area to this day has fully demonstrated your ability and strength as a "leader"."
 Konigsberg_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 ""People ultimately love their desires, not what they want. "Ha! This is not wrong at all! Humans are higher creatures that act out of desire!"
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_1:0 "Is it good luck or bad luck? I have seen the harshest weather on the sea...the body seems to be torn apart by the storm."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_2:0 "Fighting and retreating is also a tactic."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_3:0 "The reason why the port area is so peaceful is the embodiment of your strength, sir."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sir, keep your spirits up even at night. The flames of war may ignite at any time."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_5:0 "It's better not to leave the port at night, the reef or something, the most annoying..."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_6:0 "Night tour... the port area at night is really interesting compared to the daytime."
  Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Although the testing process of new technologies is full of risks, it is precisely because of the unknown "mystery" that people are eager to try. But please remember, safety first."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Rushing on the battlefield, calling it bravery, it is actually a manifestation of unconscionable. The purpose of naval guns is to break their ridiculous fantasies."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Looking at the food in the restaurant, I can't help but think of the food on board the ship... It is described as "a world of difference", but there is no exaggeration."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Don't listen to her nonsense, Cologne. How to make this dish depends on your own mind. No one can help you make the decision, you are the master of your soul."
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Oscar, the number of times you sneak out recently has increased. Could it be that you are conspiring with any plan? Ha, you are just a cat, how could it be-you just... were relieved? "
 Karlsruhe_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "At this time, there is no need to remind you to take a break, right? Well, this is also an improvement. You have done your best and don't need to work too hard. Good night, see you tomorrow."

 Sirius_TouchDialog_4:0 "The scars on my body will fade away over time, making us stronger. So don’t worry, these scars will disappear soon and I will become stronger."
 Sirius_TouchDialog_5:0 "The fear of the night comes from people's anxiety about the unknown. If you can see wider and farther, then it won't be so. Even so, the night is more fascinating because of this. What do you think? This night? The starry sky, are you also fascinated by it?"
 Sirius_TouchDialog_6:0 "I can't see the star with the same name for 70 days every year. Is it too dazzling to cause dissatisfaction with the sun?"
 Sirius_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "As long as you are by my side, I will fight hard, and the light in your eyes, I am afraid that death will evade it."
  Sirius_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Every day I am with you is as warm as summer."

 Omaha_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The sheriff is here! The things you criminals are hiding have been targeted by me for a long time, and... Time to come again..."
 Omaha_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The subtlety of patrol is to pinpoint the opponent's weakness, for example, let me see... Is your weakness here or... here? Hehe, don't run!"
 Omaha_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The commander is still lying in bed, let me check if there are any prohibited items in the office..."
 Omaha_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "There is one thing, I don’t know if I should tell you...it's embarrassing to say it...it’s better not to put private things in the second drawer on the left side of the desk..."

 Atlanta_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Because of work, I often stay up late, but it turns into a day and night routine like a cat... It's a headache, so I can spend less and less time with the commander... Find a chance to change I don’t know if San Francisco can agree..."
 Atlanta_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The commander is thinking about Atlanta! Although he is on duty, although it is far apart, I can feel it!

 Juneau_TouchDialog_1:0 "Be sure to keep the radar and other signal transmission tools normal during the battle, so that the friendly forces can be notified as soon as there is a danger. Of course, my signal tools are special. Guess it is...Ah! You, you arrested me again Tail……"
 Juneau_TouchDialog_2:0 "Fables always say that people with umbrellas are more likely to get soaked in the rain. This is because people are always overconfident in their strengths, leading to insufficient awareness of prevention. In fact, there are people outside the world, It’s your strengths, the more you need to be cautious."
 Juneau_TouchDialog_3:0 "Commander, just wait and see, I will definitely make a lot of achievements, so that you will remember my name not because of a failure, but because of my success!"
 Juneau_TouchDialog_4:0 "No matter what happens, it is too late to remedy things until things happen, so all emergency plans must be planned in advance, do you understand? Commander, here, and here, it needs to be revised!"
 Juneau_TouchDialog_5:0 "The two tails brought me not only the enhancement of strength, but also the weakness, as if the strong deliberately exposed the most vulnerable parts to the enemy's field of vision... It is a contradictory design."
 Juneau_TouchDialog_6:0 "Atlanta! You, you are reading my thoughts again! It's true... It's really rare that you can persevere with such a powerful ability to solve trivial things in the port area every day..."
 Juneau_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Huh-the air in the morning is so good, I must hurry up and exercise... By the way, leave a note to the commander: Today, I want to drink hot milk and add a little hot chocolate. When I come back from training, I will check the results!"
 Juneau_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "It's so comfortable to have a sun in the afternoon, ah? You didn't hear anything, did you?!"
 Juneau_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sullivan, it's not that I have to say you, can you protect yourself a little on the battlefield, and always sacrifice yourself for her...you think your status is more important..."
 Juneau_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "What is Miss Wasp thinking about? You clearly remember that you used to be a little tempered but lively and cheerful person. How come you suddenly become so serious, you really can’t get used to it... Of course, I’m not qualified to say it. You, I am also changing silently. I wonder if anyone noticed it?"
 Juneau_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Miss San Francisco, are you still blaming yourself for that mistake? It's actually not her fault..."
 Juneau_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Please, for a personal matter, can I join Sullivan next time on the expedition? ... It's okay, this kid is too reluctant to do it, I want to protect her, it's that simple."
 OHiggins_TouchDialog_1:0 "I only need to protect the peace, nationality is not important."
 OHiggins_TouchDialog_2:0 "This dress is really interesting, does the commander like it?"
 OHiggins_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hey, this kind of training feels a little missed..."
 OHiggins_TouchDialog_4:0 "The battle has taken me too much. I only hope that this kind of war will not happen again. This is the reason why I live."
 OHiggins_TouchDialog_5:0 "The weather tonight reminds me of a certain battle, which is really unpleasant..."

 OHiggins_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Oh-Commander, it seems to be boring, then... (kiss) Go on!"
  OHiggins_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "This kind of scrupulous training is really boring. If the commander comes in a while, please take the opportunity to slip away..."
 OHiggins_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It's not the same as American dance. This kind of animal-simulating primitive dance has a different style... It's too boring to look at. Hey, Commander, shall we go dance with them?"
 OHiggins_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The battle is so boring... Commander, do you think there might be another world? Everything is decided by singing and dancing... Hehe, it will be fun!"
 OHiggins_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It's also calm today. Would you like a drink? It's fun to have a drink occasionally."
 Helena_TouchDialog_1:0 "It is not a good habit to watch the fire from across the shore, but when the scene is too chaotic, even I have to do it."
 Helena_TouchDialog_2:0 "There is a lot of information that needs to be sorted out every day, and these are even more important than fighting."
 Helena_TouchDialog_3:0 "Does the Commander have any tasks for me today?"

 Helena_TouchDialog_5:0 "Is there anything I can help to explore?"
 Helena_TouchDialog_6:0 "The radar seems to be working properly. It seems that I can have a good rest tonight."
 Helena_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Your daily dress is really a bit... well, I will help you decide how to dress every day from now on."
 Helena_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Today's training plan is completed, call... Commander, how are you, is your work going well?"
 Helena_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Even if you were so foolish at the beginning, you can become so reassuring. Time is really a magical thing..."
 Helena_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It's not okay to be picky eaters~! This is a nutritious dinner I carefully prepared for you. Don't eat those junk foods in the future."
 Helena_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The lights at night are so beautiful, aren't they? But if it's a burning flame, it makes people feel scared... Sorry, it's such a romantic atmosphere, but I said something untimely..."
 Helena_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I really want to be with you like this. You don't need a romantic confession, and you don't need to deliberately create any atmosphere. That's enough..."
 NingHai_TouchDialog_1:0 "Ninghai is also working hard today!"
 NingHai_TouchDialog_2:0 "My training method seems to be able to provide some help for everyone."
 NingHai_TouchDialog_3:0 "Admiral, is there anything interesting to tell Ning Hai today?"
 NingHai_TouchDialog_4:0 "Ping Hai is a very emotional child, the admiral should take good care of her."
 NingHai_TouchDialog_5:0 "I really like this quiet harbor, how about you?"
 NingHai_TouchDialog_6:0 "If you didn't meet the admiral, it would be hard to imagine who you are today."
 NingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Are you tired? No, don’t worry, if I’m really tired, I’ll take a vacation and rest, but now I’m healthy in Ninghai! Hehe, don’t worry."
 NingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ping Hai, don't force yourself! Hey, admiral, tell me about this child Ping Hai, let her take a day off... Hey, I want to take a day off together? Why, why, I... take care of Ping Hai Thank you."
 NingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Admiral, Admiral-haven't you eaten yet? Hey, I know you workaholics have no time to eat when you are busy. I made some with Yixian and brought them to you... Hee hee, eat slowly , Don't choke."
 NingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Weird... the eyelids are a little heavy, I need to wash my face... Hey, I obviously have a good rest every day, why... so tired...whoo-"
 NingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Did I fall asleep just now? This quilt is... the admiral has been here?"
 NingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Also say about me, obviously I can't fight well. Fortunately, I think I will send a bowl of soup before I go back so late. The last time the quilt seems to be placed... Ah! I found it, right there. Sit here for a while and wait for the admiral to wake up..."
 PingHai_TouchDialog_1:0 "Has Pinghai become amazing! In fact, it is amazing!"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_2:0 "PingHai will be the real fleet number one!"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hehe, Pinghai's aiming ability is very good, do you want to give it a try?"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hopefully one day I can also become the main force of the admiral and protect this harbor."
 PingHai_TouchDialog_5:0 "Ping Hai learned a culinary skill from sister Ning Hai. Would you like the admiral to give it a try?"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_6:0 "Oh oh... everyone in the fleet likes Ping Hai so much! What a joy!"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey! Today's breakfast was made by Pinghai for you! Come and taste...how about it?..."
 PingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ping Hai passed the exercise smoothly today! Although it was due to teammates...hehehe...but I didn't hold back!...Hey, will there be rewards like this? Or is it only Pinghai has it?! "
 PingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "My generation has been in the army and defending the country. I have already left my life and death out of the way... Maybe, compared with the predecessors, my efforts are not enough! Not enough! Admiral, please supervise my training! Strictly demand me!"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Although I am very tired, I still want to go to training... I'm a little dizzy, yes... Ah! Admiral! What are you going to do? Why are you holding me up! Even if you want to send me back Don't... (blushing) Really, really not ashamed, to say such things..."
 PingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "(Dream) Hehe... The chicken feet made by the admiral himself are really, really delicious (bite)... Hey, admiral, what's wrong with you? It's so terrible, ah, what happened to your hand! Bleeding !"
 PingHai_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Admiral, I, I have found a lot of fireworks, do you want to show them together?"
 Roberts_TouchDialog_1:0 "As a shallow-water heavy artillery, my most important duty is to provide fire support to all my sisters, so training in hitting is essential."
 Roberts_TouchDialog_2:0 "Did the commander come to see me for training again? Cover your ears~"
 Roberts_TouchDialog_3:0 "If you have a chance, you must practice artillery with Senior Hood."
 Roberts_TouchDialog_4:0 "My main gun was given to me by a senior, so I must cherish it!"
 Roberts_TouchDialog_5:0 "Commander, tell you a little secret, don’t look at Abbey Kronbe who is usually dull and silent, but in her heart, your words are very important. So, you know what to do~ trouble NS."
 Roberts_TouchDialog_6:0 "Are you still working at so late? Then let me wait for you and go back with you."
 Roberts_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Commander, today I have an appointment to call Abbey Kronbe to hang out with, now let's go find her? She should be coming soon... She must be walking fast with such a heavy cannon! But she is two hours ahead of schedule Go out!"
 Roberts_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hey, what is this... Little Crab? Little Crab, are you lost? How come you came to the training ground? It's dangerous here!... (Whispering) There are a lot of wicked big sisters~"
 Roberts_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 ""Ah-so heavy, I can't stand it anymore! Help--! "If Xiao Cannon can speak, he will complain like that~"
 Roberts_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The tortoise and the hare race exists in reality~ If you bring a ship outfit, I am a rabbit, and Abercrombie is a little tortoise; but if you don’t bring a ship outfit... Commander, you will definitely be scared. It's a big jump~"
 Roberts_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, commander, accompany me to walk on the beach...ah? I don't know what to do on the beach...this...the love secret code given by Miss London doesn't work, this script is completely wrong... "
 Roberts_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The Mr. Crab who was released that day, will you still meet on the beach? Ah-it may be Miss Crab..."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_1:0 "Today's training content is also very substantial, please rest assured, I will try my best."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_2:0 "Speaking of which, Roberts has recently become obsessed with a weapon called a crossbow, which seems to be very lethal..."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_3:0 "Every time I invite the destroyer's friends to train together, I was rejected..."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_4:0 "Are you still working so late? It's really hard. When I finish my physical training in the evening, I will help you do it together."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_5:0 "What? It turns out that my sister and the commander knew that I used to sneak out to train before... It's embarrassing..."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_6:0 "Low speed is sometimes not a bad thing, because it is more conducive to more precise strikes on the enemy."
  Abercrombie_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Everyone must train hard~! I will accompany you to train artillery... and the commander will also work together... Hey, I'll help you decide without authorization..."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Also, half an hour to arrive at the appointment location, goggling, help me send a letter to the commander, this time... it will definitely not be late!"
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Look, the morning glory at the foot of the wall is blooming. Although no one cares at all, even the sun may not be able to shine, but they are also working hard to grow...Sometimes, plants can also become our role models. "
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I am still a little embarrassed to teach in front of everyone...If you make a mistake, then you will be embarrassed... Commander, you can check it for me..."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I used to give myself special training every night, and never noticed...the night-shrouded port area, so beautiful..."
 Abercrombie_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Gu Gu likes to go out and fly around at night, but he has no energy during the day... It's strange..."
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_1:0 "The admiral always shows up unexpectedly. Is he playing peekaboo with Fubuki? Huh eh eh!? The admiral...Admiral!!! This time from the bottom of the table?!"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_2:0 "As a elder sister, naturally you have to lead by example. You can't relax every time you train and devote yourself to it. In this way, you will be able to sweep away the previous image... Probably?"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_3:0 "As long as the power of special destroyers is assembled, there is nothing that can't be overcome! This power is us who are drawn by fetters-the highest glory."
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_4:0 "The admiral has kept secrets well. Fubuki did not live up to the admiral's expectations, eh!"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_5:0 "At first it was just a training alone, then Shen Xue joined, and Shi Bo also came. It's really...it feels like there is no hiding from others..."
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_6:0 "Visiting is also a kind of training! The admiral will also come together, so let's change your mood a little."
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Although I asked Shirayuki to teach me how to make chocolate, but I don’t know how it tastes likewow, wow! Mention, the admiral! Gifts, gifts!! Fubuki made it myself!!!"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 ""Love, this is not one heart beating another heart, but the spark of two hearts colliding together. "Eh~ how do two hearts collide? It's always hard to understand what you say... Ah, you are also the admiral~ you must know it! Right!"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "...This is a scarf made for the admiral! Although I am not very skilled, Fubuki will work hard! Let Shirayuki know that my sister is also making progress! Wow!? The admiral!? No, nothing! What's up! Nothing! Oh oh oh... there really is nothing!"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "This ring is a precious treasure for Fuxue and the Admiral. Cleaning up is indispensable-oh wow!! Ti, admiral? Don't appear suddenly!... Ring, ring flew away! Where have I been...you are also coming here to help find it!!!"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Unexpectedly, the admiral would be a wicked man... and he didn't come to help, but kept staring at others...ohhh, it's not funny at all! Bad admiral! I'm going to throw the ring away?! Huh? Don’t hug suddenly"
 Fubuki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It's so bold, Admiral... If Shirayuki sees it, maybe what it will be like... But... Fubuki doesn't hate it. Being cherished and recognized by others is probably what Fubuki has always wanted" Treasure "Well...thank you, Admiral."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_1:0 "My sister's clumsy appearance is the truest one. But no matter how she changes, she is my favorite sister."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_2:0 "One person's power may not be able to control the battle, but as long as we gather together-our special destroyer will never disappoint you."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_3:0 "I have prepared the afternoon tea, do you want to join it too? Ah! Don't steal it!"
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sorrowful night... Sister and the others are going to train again. Um... Let’s make a little midnight snack."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_5:0 "Because I cared too much, I didn't notice the subtle changes in the first time. My sister...finally grew into a "sister"."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_6:0 "Admiral? You can't fall asleep here. If you catch a cold...I will feel bad too..."
  Shirayuki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The warm sunshine and the leisurely sea breeze make one feel a moment of peace and tranquility...Ah, do you feel it too? It’s also good to serve the admiral in such an atmosphere. I hope so. The time can become "eternal"."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Before this, the most important thing to me was my sister. However, I always felt that something was missing. It was your presence that filled this gap. I love my sister and you as well. I will be by your side, welcoming every sunrise together, and admiring every sunset together."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The admiral? Well, this is the so-called "Kagura", not a joyful dance. If you are fine, please stop for now. Next... I prepared it for you, and dedicated it only to you. Dance"
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The snow will be especially bright at night because the snow will reflect more light. I will be so gentle to you because you let me feel the warmth like a warm spring. The snow will finally melt. Even if I know I am going to melt, I will dedicate everything I have to you."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I am not good at commanding others. But if I need my help, whether it is the admiral or the sister, I will do my best to do my best."
 Shirayuki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Are you asleep? So, good night...Ah, you are not asleep yet, it seems that I disturbed you...I always wanted to say good night to you, but I never realized it... Because as long as I look at you, my heart will throbbing..."
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_1:0 "Good morning, Admiral~ Do you have any plans for today? Let me guess, I must be sitting in the admiral’s room and staring at the screen in a daze~ Hahaha, you are better than me to make people guess it~ "
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_2:0 "Although the torpedo has a long range, there are too many uncontrollable factors! I prefer to believe in the main gun in my hand and my own eyes. But I also want to thank the predecessors for their teaching~ I can’t think of it as interesting alone. Of tactics~"
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_3:0 ""As long as we gather the power of our special destroyers, there is nothing we can't do. "I believe my sister must often say this to the admiral, and I am the same. We are a whole, and no one can do without anyone."
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_4:0 "They are all equipped with torpedo reloading devices, which sounds a bit enviable? It's weird. Even if they can reload quickly, whether they can hit someone is another matter. Anyway, I think that torpedoes are all. Not reliable."
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_5:0 "Still working on the files, Lord AdmiralAha! Sure enough, admit it~ How~ After putting your hair down, do you look like your sister~ It's a pity, I'm not here to help~ You keep working hard Right~"
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_6:0 "Ah...it’s so boring, sister~sister~ let’s go training~ or do some supper, everything is fine, I don’t want to sit here anymore~ boring but chronic poison"
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "My dream? Haha, you are asking strange questions again~ How to say, "dream" is not clear at all. What is "dream" and how many "dreams" are there, totally It’s just empty talk~ Hey, don’t you feel disappointed~"
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Love" is also an illusory thing, but it has a concrete manifestation because of the connection between people. Just like you and me now, we can stand here and talk about these strange issues, which is not correct. Is it the so-called "love" performance~"
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 ""The Eleventh Destroyer Team"-a familiar and unfamiliar name. It's like a dream about to dissolve in Asahi, too illusory and too dazzling. What I want to protect is exactly one of them Everyone. And you are my strong backing."
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Huh~ I really want a bottle of marble soda after eating~ Great satisfaction~ Then I will prepare for a long-distance running~ Burn out the extra calories! Admiral~ Can you catch up to my speed? Hey, If you catch up with me, make a wish~ Then-let's start!"
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hahaha! You are still too naive! You want to catch up with me~ But for your motivation, let me give you an extra wish~ So~ what do you want? I can accept It’s okay within the range"
 Hatsuyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "So hungry... Sister should be asleep at this time, I'll go get something to eat by myself. Ah, admiral, do you have something to eat? But unfortunately~ I only know curry and omelet rice. ~You have no choice, haha~"
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_1:0 "Training is a long and boring process, but in order to prove that I am not a "ghost ship", I can persevere in any trial!"
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_2:0 "I can talk to her normally now! Ah...but the physical contact is still a bit...I don't know what will happen suddenly...precaution, prevent trouble! I'm not afraid!"
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_3:0 "What "the strongest mine envoy"... My sister is talking nonsense everywhere again. If I am so strong, I must teach her first! The bully should be-oh my sister! !? Help...Help!!!"
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_4:0 "Quick torpedo reloading device...I want to try how useful it is. Should I borrow it from her? Hey? Can't equip it? How could this be..."
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_5:0 "Walking barefoot on the beach... Feeling the rhythm of the fine sand and sea, as if you have become a part of the coast."
  Miyuki_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sudden power outage?! This is troublesome, and the work has not been completed yet-there is no one else around? The inspection is over... Please, Yukino! Hmm! The brightness is just right~ the work is over and I will take you to have a snack~"
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sister? I agreed to train together... I won't go with my second sister again... Damn, I want to eat all their lunch tomorrow!"
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "My sister looks serious, but it will be revealed with just a single poke-oh! It's useless to poke me! Stop it! Stop, stop! You fool! !"
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Mahjong...? No! Mahjong is terrible! It's not fun at all! How can anyone keep blooming on the ridge and fishing for the moon!!"
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The third sister always likes to say some beautiful words to hide her true thoughts. Isn't this considered her cute side? Hey? Hey hey?! Why can't I get up-ah ah ah! Even my sister Unforgivable!!!"
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Although the sashimi is delicious, I still think cooked food is better. Huh? Of course it’s because the things in the sea are a bit strange recently. Didn’t you catch a strange fish the other day? I put it in the crystal. In the ball... the adult's thinking is really hard to understand..."
 Miyuki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "You don’t need to say the sweet words until now...you, you are still passionate about it! Ha, haha...Huh? Do you have to? You can’t help me... I like you, Dear, dear"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_1:0 "Turning on the searchlights during the night battle is a very difficult task. Naturally, Master Akatsuki will complete this important task!"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_2:0 "Ha...Helena?! Me, me, I didn't do anything!? Eh...Admiral!? Don't be deliberately scary! Take off that mask!"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_3:0 "As long as I can protect everyone in the sixth expulsion team, it doesn't matter how much I give, who makes me a sister! Humph~"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_4:0 "A dark port area...Admiral, lighting at night is also very important."
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_5:0 "Although searchlights are used at night, they are not just for lighting!"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_6:0 "Huh, my lord, I won't lose to "Drowsiness". This bet is undoubtedly my victory."
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ah ah~ when can she come? I want to talk to her about the past. Ah, loud~what nonsense, of course you are the most important~ no one can compare to you~ the admiral, You won't be jealous anymore, are you? You've been sternly there~"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I'm my sister~ So-mature temperament is taken for granted~ Look at your obsessive eyes, just like a child sees candy. Humph, just say as many beautiful words as you can think of~ I am pleased. I will give you a reward~"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Haha, look at this! It's funny~ eh? Admiral, what's the matter? You look surprised. It's not because I'm sitting with Helena, right? This lord is not in trouble all day. what are you thinking about!"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Admiral~What are you looking for? It's so dark outside, how can you find it in the grass without any lighting equipment! Come on~ I can borrow the lights from this lord! No thanks~ Stay Will remember to give it back to me~"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Um... this book is really ugly, what I read is really jerky... As expected of my sister! What are you talking about! I can understand it! Just read it! What's so great Yeah... eh... eh... flow, meteor!!"
 Akatsuki_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Tomorrow is the day of the expedition. It is also one of my sister’s duties to prepare lunch for everyone on the road~ Anyway~ Can you come and help? I will make an extra for you~ Just tell what you want to eat. My lord, hum~"
 Verniy_TouchDialog_1:0 "Each screw has its own value."
  Verniy_TouchDialog_2:0 "The image has changed, and the mood has also changed, but those that have not changed remain the same."
 Verniy_TouchDialog_3:0 "Although it was equipped with a new type of weapon, it failed to participate in a decent battle... Looking back now, it's a shame."
 Verniy_TouchDialog_4:0 "Always stuck to the past cannot grow. My partner in Siberia taught me this."
 Verniy_TouchDialog_5:0 "Yes, I can also conduct a night tour alone. The pages of the past have been rewritten by me."
 Verniy_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sister? Really... I said you don't have to worry about it. It's okay... Let's visit the rest of the place together."
 Verniy_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The warm sun in the afternoon is a bit immersive. Would you like to sit here and enjoy this quiet time with me."
 Verniy_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 ""Love, this is not one heart beating another heart, but the spark of two hearts colliding together. "Admiral, you must be able to understand the meaning of this sentence..."
 Verniy_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "This thing... is Coke? Thank you for your kindness, but I don't need it. How to say, it should be a matter of principle? Anyway, I can't drink this. If I can, can you give me a glass of vodka or soda? "
 Verniy_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 ""The child grows up after falling and then falling. "Frustration is growth, and so is "love". However, the perfect "love", even if it encounters setbacks, there will be no cracks. Just like you and me, yes, that's right."
 Verniy_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Believe in yourself, you can do it. Even if you are alone, you are not "a person". Beside you, there is a "phoenix" guarding you."
 Verniy_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Sister, what are you looking at? Ah, it turns out that this book is with you. I have been looking for it for a day... How come there are tears on your face? Oh, is that so? I'll teach Sister Xiao to cry People, please wait a moment."
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_1:0 "Even on the battlefield, you cannot persecute the unarmed. What should be done at this time should be to extend a helping hand. What's wrong? Is what I said strange?"
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_2:0 "As the manager of the Minato City, the admiral should be the strongest person in Minato City? How about going to the drill field and having a one-on-one confrontation with me now?"
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_3:0 "Faith, I believe she has finally become strong. It seems that Siberia is really a magical place. Does the admiral know anyone over there?"
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_4:0 "Has the work been completed? Let's go to inspect the port area together, Admiral!"
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_5:0 "Wow, sisters are all here! It's really lively here, don't you think so, Admiral?"
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_6:0 "My sister can fall asleep without needing me to accompany me. Although it is a little bit lost, it is not a bad thing. Hmm! After all, I have grown up!"
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "If you want to become stronger, isn't it all to protect others. If you gain power, but you don't share this power with others, you go against your original intention from the beginning. Think about it carefully, isn't it? It makes sense? Ha, but there is no need to care~ I'll be there!"
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The connection between people is not so simple and clear. If you want to be easy to understand, hold each other's hands and look into each other's eyes! Then-feel each other Heartbeat. How? Do you feel it?"
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I learned to fish recently~ Waiting for the prey to be hooked is somewhat similar to laying mines. Interesting, do you want to try it too? Haha, be careful not to get caught by the hook. !"
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Admiral? It would be better to take a proper rest? It does not matter when you work. Relaxation is also a way of life. You are right to listen to me!"
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "As long as you muster up the courage, you can do it! Okay~ Which cup is the gold coin in now! Admiral, it's your turn! If you guess wrong, the consequences will be very serious~ Have you decided? Then the result is "
 Ikazuchi_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "There is no absolute weak, and no absolute strong. Just like me and you, from a normal point of view, I am definitely stronger than you. But from another perspective, you have something a hundred times stronger than me. Huh? What is that thing~"
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_1:0 "Did you say that I look more like a sister? You can't let the sisters hear this kind of words-ah, it seems to be too late~"
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_2:0 "I have always wanted to say sorry to someone, but every time I will be cleverly avoided, it is really a headache. Admiral, can... Forget it, it's better to explain this kind of thing in person."
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_3:0 "Sister, she occasionally does some unreasonable things on the battlefield...Ah, I am the same, should I say that I am a sister?"
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_4:0 "I always feel the cat's cry? Is it ginger? Or is it fish cake?"
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_5:0 "A fulfilling job will give people a sense of accomplishment. Admiral, do you feel that way?"
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_6:0 "The harbor at night, under the light of the lighthouse, has a little dreamlike feeling."
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The word "fetter" is so cruel to use, but yeah, I like the word. Even if it is the so-called "fetter", I am also very happy. Because, at the other end of the "fetter", It's you."
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Fishing... I don't like to wait. Compared with my sisters, I like to fight in a more direct way. How to put it, it's probably impatient~"
  Inazuma_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Because I have grown up, I see things differently. But my impression of you has not changed at all. Hmm~Want to know your impression of me? Just~Don’t tell you. ~"
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "People who like shiny things are probably simple-minded. Ah, it's just my subconscious feeling. For example, who? You must have the answer in your heart~"
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Love is a very pure thing, there are not so many oblique places. For example, when I say "I love you" now I just love you purely, and there is no other meaning~ ah? You blushed~"
 Inazuma_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "You don't have to stare at me all the time, I can patrol alone. Don't worry, I will be fine. Sometimes, I also need to "let go"~"
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_1:0 "South Dakota is a very admirable opponent! If you can, I really want to fight her again!"
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_2:0 "There are too many things that can be determined in one battle, so you can't relax at one time."
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_3:0 "It is very dangerous to have fewer enemies and more enemies, but when you are highly concentrated, it will explode beyond common sense!"
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_4:0 "Am I a little slow in terms of "feelings"? Maybe... I need to ask Sister Fuxue and Shirayuki for advice?"
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_5:0 "Have you encountered any problems in handling documents? Sorry... I am not very good at dealing with these..."
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_6:0 ""Solomon's Ghosts and Gods"? Now I am just a secretary ship, you don't need to worry. This power will only be used against the enemy."
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "What are you looking at me for? Ah! Is it going to attack?! Yes! I am ready at any time! Ah? Isn't it? Really disappointing."
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Since just now, you have been staring at me, what do you want to do? Don’t you sayWant to try it with me?! I have this intention! Just how strong you are, let me Huh? Isn't it? Why is this..."
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "...Huh? I'm not looking forward to it anymore, so you can say it slowly. Ah...Huh? "Like"? What kind of emotion is that...? Sorry, I don't understand it very well. If you can teach What I said, I should understand."
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "What kind of feeling is "like"? Woo...It's really incomprehensible, "feeling". But with you, I feel that everything has a solution. We will always be together. "
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Admiral, that... well, this is the snack I tried to make. Will you be happy? If you are happy, I am... very happy. I seem to understand, what is "like"--"
 Ayanami_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "This smile... I want to keep... the emotion that has emerged in my heart, it must be"
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_1:0 "Let’s change from the smile first? Admiral, I’m laughing now? Really, you don’t understand anything."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_2:0 "When did it start? Obviously, I think it's something I'm accustomed to, and there are some deviations. I have some unexpected feelings."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_3:0 "Since the transformation has been carried out, it is natural not to lose to sisters of the same type. In this case, the admiral can also..."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_4:0 "Admiral, do you need me to help with the paperwork? It happens to be my area of ​​expertise."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_5:0 "Deep...ah, it's time for training. Admiral, I have to be away for a while, sorry."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_6:0 "Ah...sorry, did you wake you up? I would catch a cold when you fall asleep like this. I want to put it on you... I probably don't need it now, it's a pity."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Admiral, what do you want to do today? The newly released novel, do you want to read it together? Well, it is definitely not the kind of waste paper that is piled up with dull words."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 ""Admiral ~ Governor ~ Jun, today's fortune is-do you still believe this? Um~ It's really innocent~" The so-called childhood sweethearts, maybe this is the feeling, right? They are just friends who have seized the opportunity and are thinking about further development...Ah, I seemed to have a terrible expression just now. Did you scare you?"
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Huh? I'm not angry. Why should I be angry, because the admiral is such a carefree person, I know. But next time you are with me, you will stare at the other children. It will be terrible to end."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Love, maybe that's the way it is. It seems like a dull daily life, a fixed schedule, but I already have you by my side. With you, even ordinary days, there is a different kind of scenery."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "You who are dull, have a time to take the initiative. That action contributed to you and me today. Ah, do you need to say congratulations? Another step in the great direction, Admiral."
 Shikinami_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Sister, she is worrying about the feeling of "liking", the admiral, you must have said something strange to her again? She is not my type. It must be done step by step. Ah, I am not here. Remind you, don't think too much."
 Z1_TouchDialog_1:0 "Z1 me, I am very afraid of carrier-based aircraft. Rather, the friendly carrier-based aircraft is the most terrible..."
  Z1_TouchDialog_2:0 "What are you looking at, sir? The bow? No...Don't stare like that..."
 Z1_TouchDialog_3:0 "As the flagship of the Z series, I will definitely lead the sisters to victory!"
 Z1_TouchDialog_4:0 "Ah, sir...Don’t run around at night, I just set up a trap."
 Z1_TouchDialog_5:0 "This kid Z16, what do you stare at Z31 every day and say..."
 Z1_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sir, be optimistic about my sisters, otherwise I can't guarantee that they will run out of our sight..."
 Z1_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ah-is it an air raid? I was so scared, scared to death... I disturbed you... I'm really sorry..."
 Z1_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Look, there are starfish here, so cute! Hey...sir, do you say we will hurt them when we fight?"
 Z1_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It seems to be able to lead everyone to victory, sir, have I become much better?"
 Z1_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Woo-today's exercise was inexplicably hit by our own plane...it hurts..."
 Z1_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Sir, is it really okay to put Z16 on? I want to learn Hipper's hair dyeing, and I want to learn how adults drink beer...what if...what if you break down?"
 Z1_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "If you are not your sister, you don't have to force yourself to be your best, and you don't have to participate in so many wars, and you can always be by your side... Hey, this is a very irresponsible idea..."
 Z16_TouchDialog_1:0 "Our Z drive has a clear division of labor. Sister Z1 is responsible for leading the team forward, and I am responsible for putting a gift where the enemy does not pay attention~ hee hee~"
 Z16_TouchDialog_2:0 "Did the Z16 become very powerful after the transformation? Thank you for your compliment, but, have you not noticed any other changes?"
 Z16_TouchDialog_3:0 "Sister Z17 and Z18 are really reassuring partners. With their help, the task can be very easy and enjoyable."
 Z16_TouchDialog_4:0 "The arrangement of mines is a very interesting thing~ Imagine suddenly entering a mine belt while sailing, hehe-BOOM!"
 Z16_TouchDialog_5:0 "Hey~ the charm of this adult is one of the best among the destroyers. Z31, you also reform...oh, this sense of frustration..."
 Z16_TouchDialog_6:0 "Sir, you just finished your work. It's really hard... You ask me, my working hours have just begun~"
 Z16_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "This training task is really easy! Sir~ (whispering) Is there any special training for Z16?"
 Z16_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Oh, sir, come and take a look, is my dress good-looking today? Hee hee~ just like it."
 Z16_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I'm so tired... I don't want to move at all, otherwise, hee hee, you will leave the task of carrying me back to you."
 Z16_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "No, you are not allowed to stare at Z31!! Don't look at me with strange eyes!"
 Z16_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Although the night duty is a bit uneasy, as long as you are by my side, you will be extra relaxed...Of course, if someone dares to spoil this romantic environment, I will not hesitate to make her pay the price."
 Z16_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "How can I be as handsome as Hipper? Sir, do you think I should dye my hair green?"
 Z21_TouchDialog_1:0 "Z22, don't fall into fear because the enemy is strong, don't forget, I am your sister, even if the sky falls, I will help you carry it."
 Z21_TouchDialog_2:0 "With this equipment, I can finally help you better, please rest assured, I will not disappoint your expectations."
 Z21_TouchDialog_3:0 "This edelweiss was given to me by a friend. As long as I am still alive, I will definitely protect it."
  Z21_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sir, look, Edward is also very happy today? Ah... Edward is the name of this flower... Didn't I tell you before?"
 Z21_TouchDialog_5:0 "When I was very weak, I thought it would be better to become stronger, and to become stronger, I can let everyone remember myself. But now that I really experience this kind of change, I find that I am completely unprepared...before I've said a lot of big things, I hope you don't take it to heart."
 Z21_TouchDialog_6:0 "Whenever I feel upset, looking at this edelweiss, my heart can't help but calm down..."
 Z21_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I'm ready, let's go! Have you decided where to go to play today?...I can do it, really do it, I'm happy everywhere with you."
 Z21_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I don't know when I can go to Narvik again, I think this edelweiss likes it very much..."
 Z21_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It was found that war exhaustion... the combat mode is activated, no, no, it seems better to hide and wait for her to leave now... but it would be very unwilling..."
 Z21_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "What kind of feeling does Bismarck's so-called inner strength feel? What exactly is...what?! A sneaky figure sneaks into...that direction is...the chief's office!"
 Z21_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "If there is a question about the oversight of the security department, I will hold them accountable later... But now, sir, it’s time to repay your trust. Come on, don’t you group of deep seas just want to hijack the sir? Step over my corpse, or, die."
 Z21_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Um-no, it doesn't hurt! It doesn't hurt at all! I, I'm fine with so many enemies, how could it be painful because of rubbing medicine... Ah, it hurts... Light, lighter, Anyway, I saved you too. Don't be so rough. Well, I... did a good job, right?"
 Z22_TouchDialog_1:0 "Please don't worry if you leave it to me, I will take the task only if I have confidence."
 Z22_TouchDialog_2:0 "Z21 and I mine mine every day to gain an advantage in combat, but our focus is different. He prefers to lure the enemy into a place that is good for our attack, and I prefer to make the opponent feel uncomfortable when attacking. ."
 Z22_TouchDialog_3:0 "Breeding is over, the next step is to invite Miss Brave to come here for another fair duel, hehe, this time...I won't lose again."
 Z22_TouchDialog_4:0 "Do you need me?...Do you need my help?...If you need it, I will tell me, just ask me, I will help you, hehe~"
 Z22_TouchDialog_5:0 "Should no one admit me wrong now?... In the past few years, I have not only become stronger, but also a lot more beautiful, and I also pay attention to dressing up... It should make everyone impress me!"
 Z22_TouchDialog_6:0 "Can I be the flagship next time? Can you please~"
 Z22_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Looking at how relaxed you are today, would you like to do something for me? ... Don't worry, it's not a very tiring job. Do some snacks for me. Isn't it troublesome?"
 Z22_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Sister Z21 is really getting more and more handsome. In comparison, I am a little weak... Sir, do you prefer her or me?"
 Z22_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sister Z1 and Z16 are very serious in doing things, me? I work very hard too... Haven't you seen it? Or you are paying attention to me and neglecting my work."
 Z22_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It's dessert time, come, come and try your own dessert...How does it taste? Is the dessert mixed with the love of two people exceptionally delicious~"
 Z22_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It's so late, the time together can pass so fast... Go to bed, good baby can't stay up late, good, close your eyes, (kiss) good night."
 Z22_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The seniors who drink too much alcohol feel really embarrassed, but occasionally I can hear them speak truth after drinking. It's not bad. If this can be done so that the officer can also say something ashamed to me... hehe, you can try Try it out."
 Z31_TouchDialog_1:0 "I also learned a lot from today's training."
 Z31_TouchDialog_2:0 "It would be nice to keep peace forever. No matter who is injured, the officer will be very sad. Z31...If you see the officer sad, you will feel sad too."
 Z31_TouchDialog_3:0 "This is a dual-mounted 150mm gun! The firepower that Z31 is proud of is not just talking about it!"
 Z31_TouchDialog_4:0 "I always feel that sister Z16's eyes are a bit strange..."
 Z31_TouchDialog_5:0 "Today's notes are also prepared, do you want to take a look at it and give some advice?"
 Z31_TouchDialog_6:0 "At night... I heard that there will be friends from other countries who often go to secretly train, I want to check it out."
 Z31_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Get up? Very conscious, as long as you put the cooked dishes in your room, you will get up soon... hee hee, go eat."
 Z31_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hey hey, I was so happy to be praised by everyone during the training today... So, let Z31 show you the strawberry sandwich biscuits that just came out of the oven. Have a taste, are they delicious?"
 Z31_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Just go to complete the mine mission with my sisters, don't worry, I will be back soon. Hey, when I come back, I will make you the black forest cake I just learned~!"
 Z31_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Sir, it seems that the older sisters like to drink beer, how about you?... Hee hee, I don't like it very much, but they will lie to me that it is juice for me to drink, so I am not so easily fooled! "
 Z31_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Although fighting skills are getting more and more proficient, I actually don't like war, but if I don't fight, I can't end all this misfortune... The temperature of your palm is the reason for my fighting."
 Z31_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Should I tell Z16 not to drink those weird drinks and drink more milk..."
  Amethyst_TouchDialog_1:0 "Today's sunshine is really warm enough, how about giving you a chance to hold an umbrella for me?"
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_2:0 "I heard that the enemy has a lot of submarines, so my new equipment is going to be effective. Please take good care of the commander."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_3:0 "Be careful of the artillery troops on the shore. Don't underestimate... Um."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_4:0 "After that tragedy, I was punished by the officer and I didn't have money to buy new clothes. However, there should be a chance to reform and refresh!"
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_5:0 "Why the enemy likes to target me in battle... Is there no way I can be forgiven?"
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, have you ever seen General Simon? Oh, that's my personal guard."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "With you by my side, I feel more at ease in training and missions."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Are you awake? Although I don't know how to take care of people, but if you need me to make breakfast, I will find a way to learn it. Before that...please bear with me."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It is so happy to be by your side, even if you have done so many rude things before, you haven't abandoned it. It's...very happy."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The moon is so beautiful. Although I used to hate that poor place, but thinking about it, the time there also left me with countless happy memories...just like being with you today."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Although many unfortunate things have happened, but you are by your side... Well, I am already very happy, and I will try my best to protect this little happiness with you."
 Amethyst_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Now I have been locked tightly by you. To put it in the tone I liked at the beginning, it is: You have fascinated me, common people, and even myself become common people."
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_1:0 "What makes people powerful is their own heart."
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_2:0 "I will give you the magic of courage~"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_3:0 "It's really sad to see everyone hurt..."
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hey hey, fireflies like commanders to touch people's heads!"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_5:0 "If a partner encounters something sad, leave it to me. Firefly is very good at making everyone happy."
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_6:0 "Is the commander still working so late? It's hard work, Firefly stays up with you!"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hee hee~ After learning the cleaning magic, organizing the commander's office has been a lot easier~! Ah... there are documents flying out again!"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Shh~ Commander, don’t speak, I came to you secretly while the sisters didn’t pay attention~"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Get close to the enemy!...Then, let me cast the magic that gives you courage!"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Xiao Ying has a lot of new clothes~ Commander, which one do you like?"
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The night is a bit cold, I remember there seems to be a kind of magic that can warm the surroundings, yes...ahhhh!
 Glowworm_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Is the ornament on the Ship Hipper? It seems to be made very realistic... Hey, what are you laughing at? Is there anything you are hiding from Xiao Ying?"
 Javelin_TouchDialog_1:0 "After the transformation, the detection ability has been greatly improved, but it still needs to be used more to become more proficient."
  Javelin_TouchDialog_2:0 "Every senior of the A-level is extremely good, they are indeed guarding the order of this port area, but... I also have some ideas on some issues.\n"
 Javelin_TouchDialog_3:0 "Rescuing the wounded in battle is also a very important job...Haha, but I still hope that I can stay on the front line more."
 Javelin_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's... a nightmare again. After all, I can't get out of the shadow of that failure..."
 Javelin_TouchDialog_5:0 "Why does Acasta-senpai always follow me blankly? Did I do something wrong and not trustworthy?"
 Javelin_TouchDialog_6:0 "I always hope that I can be stronger than all my companions... No, I mean it can protect them"
 Javelin_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "If it weren't for the despicable enemy to always hide, we wouldn't have to be so busy with work... It's annoying, Commander, I'll go out and hunt two prey back..."
 Javelin_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Find me in an hour, and we will go on a date together. Now...I want to finish today's training plan... Don't worry, you won't be left out."
 Javelin_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hahahaha! Happy! Black-backed jackal, come on! Come attack again! Bite me like a hungry wolf! Otherwise, the spear in my hand will run through your ship's outfit~!"
 Javelin_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I can hear some strange messages, but I don't know what it is... Commander, I wrote it down, let's interpret it together..."
 Javelin_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hey, hey, accompany me to sit by the beach... You are not always curious about what signal I hear? If we go together... Maybe you can hear it too~!"
 Javelin_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Did you hear it? Did you hear those strange sounds?...No? It's strange...Could it be...we are not close enough? So...now?...this way? (kiss)"
 Juno_TouchDialog_1:0 "Is the concubine going to train? Although I feel a little disappointed, as long as the commander says, I will do it well."
 Juno_TouchDialog_2:0 "Venus? Hmm...Although the kid is good, there is always something wrong with it."
 Juno_TouchDialog_3:0 "The afternoon tea party will be held here, only you and me."
 Juno_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, are you free? I just saw a very interesting story I want to tell you... The name of the story is "The Last Knitting"~"
 Juno_TouchDialog_5:0 "Javelin and Acasta? Don't worry~ It's just a small misunderstanding. I will explain to her where the Javelin is. As for Acasta, I will leave it to you, the commander~"
 Juno_TouchDialog_6:0 "Housework is omnipotent, and the knitting is exquisite? Complimenting the concubine like this will not get more benefits~ Wait, you said the cooking? Would you like to try it again?"
 Juno_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Automatic equipment is really convenient, do you want to come together? Enjoy the convenience brought by technology... But this seat can only sit on me... Then, do you want to sit on my lap? Or let me sit on your lap superior?"
 Juno_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Dare to say that my concubine is like a spider...I really don't know the height of the girl...One day, you will fall into my hands...Spiders, you won't let go of their prey~"
 Juno_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "This is an afternoon tea specially prepared for you, try it... I added a little bit of flavoring prepared by myself, how about it? Does it feel sweet?"
 Juno_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Look at you...you are sleepy again. The concubine has to sit next to you and supervise you, if you fall asleep...the concubine...but you have to punish you~"
 Juno_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It's so boring to fight and kill every day...like me, drinking tea, reading a book, and knitting something for you, this kind of life is the best...wait, I seem to hear the enemy coming! "
 Juno_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "What should I do tonight... I always feel that I haven't been out for a walk for a long time, let's go, hold me~"
 Jackal_TouchDialog_1:0 "The first step to hone the will is to exercise, Commander, come and practice with me too!"
 Jackal_TouchDialog_2:0 "Huh...it feels good to be able to train with everyone."
 Jackal_TouchDialog_3:0 "I really hope that the relationship with Javelin and the Queen can go further. Will it get better if we go out and play together?"
 Jackal_TouchDialog_4:0 "The battle itself is not the goal, why fight is the value of battle."
 Jackal_TouchDialog_5:0 "When patrolling a while ago, I saw that there were always enemy probes in the nearby waters... It seems we need to remind everyone to pay attention to safety."
 Jackal_TouchDialog_6:0 "The queen is really feminine! I have to learn from her every day..."
 Jackal_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Have an appointment with Nelson to go hunting. Do you want to go together? I will teach you how to track the prey."
 Jackal_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "It turns out that everyone is so funny...what was I thinking at the beginning, haha... Commander, thank you for bringing me to such a big family... Is it too strange? Hey..."
 Jackal_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Oh? Do you practice drills with everyone? I can't ask for it. The Javelin and Javelin didn't have a victory last time, the commander remember to cheer for me!"
 Jackal_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "You have been working for a long time, do you want to go for a walk?...Haha, just because I don't want to patrol alone, I hope and hope you can accompany me..."
 Jackal_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, you have to eat more meat. It is so hard every day. Not eating more nutrition is bad for your body...weight loss? What is that?"
 Jackal_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "From the past to the present, you have been working hard, and I will not let myself lose to you. After all, I am your partner."
  Cossack_TouchDialog_1:0 "Oh~Oscar! Have you come to play with me again? Haha, I am more suitable to be your master than the straight-faced guy!"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_2:0 "How can those pampered elders understand the charm of gang warfare! No one on the battlefield will stand there stupidly waiting for you to take aim! If you want to kill the enemy, hit it! Then pierce the enemy's heart with a single knife!"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_3:0 "A person who makes trouble everywhere without the strength can only be called a rash man. I am different from that kind of person. If you don't believe it, let's try it?"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_4:0 "Unexpectedly, people will attack without confirming the authenticity of the information... It seems that it won't make you suffer."
 Cossack_TouchDialog_5:0 "The wind is roaring, the waves are roaring, thunder is resounding in the sky-eh? Who is there?"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_6:0 "I admire indomitable people, next time, please let me and Z17 in the same team, how about?"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Practice what kind of main gun shooting and torpedoes all day long. What if these equipment fails? So I recommend everyone to be equipped with real swords and guns, so-eh eh eh???"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Oscar, I began to suspect that you just came over to eat. Why do you want to run back to that poker face when I am here? Who do you love?!"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Commander~ Are you going to the zoo? I don't need to be on duty today, I can walk around with you! Without further ado, let's go!"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Recently, I always feel that someone is eavesdropping on my singing. Really, what's so shy about it~ If you want to listen, just walk out and listen. After listening, just give me applause."
 Cossack_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Wow...Are you really a tiger? It doesn't look any different from a normal orange cat-what do you want to do!? It hurts! You bit me?!"
 Cossack_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "This suit is a proof of a fighter! The shy guy is not a real fighter at all! What are you staring at me for? You are talking about!"
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_1:0 "I change my personality type based on my exposureyou won't believe it? Hmmm...this is probably a growth trouble? Don't worry too much, I will not sleep."
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_2:0 "Miss Nelson remained serious all day long, I feel tired just looking at it. It doesn't matter if I relax occasionally? Um...Is it wearing a mask? This might make sense"
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_3:0 "Oh my god, this nasty fur collar is irritating me to death! As long as there is a breeze, it will hurl and float, and I can't concentrate at all! Why didn't I design it to be detachable... ..."
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_4:0 "I thought this thing was heavy, but now I can wave it easily...this is also the charm of growth? In short, it is gratifying to grow taller instead of being crushed into a hunch~"
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_5:0 "Huh-it's cooling down. If the night lasts, this piece of clothing will provide good protection. At other times...probably it will be damaged if it is rubbed by a cannonball..."
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_6:0 "You may not believe it-there is still a cat hidden in the hat of the Cossack! I saw it with my own eyes during the lunch break yesterday! Her hat was suddenly raised a bit, and the cat stood up like that! It's amazing, wouldn't it be tiring like that?"
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Trouble! The Cossack guy ran out to be a volunteer on the weekend, but he threw the cleaning job to me! Do your own thing first, idiot!"
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Wooha! Commander, can I ask you something? I'm going to visit the old people in the nursing home, so-the cleaning will be left to you! Goodbye!"
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Mother-in-law! I came to see you~ and brought your favorite foodhey? This mother-in-law, have we met somewhere? You look exceptionally... war-weary!"
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Oh, Commander. It seems that the cleaning is very successful~ You are really good at everything. Just kidding and joking~ Here, the condolences for you, I can't let you work in vain. Or, say, You want a kiss more~"
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "This cat that steals food is coming again...Your belly is more than three layers longer than when I first met you! If this goes on, I think you won't even be able to jump up the table! Haha! Look! What am I talking about!"
 Eskimo_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "What about love~ It's something you love me, and you didn't force this to improve your attributes, right? The kind of things that only happen in novels won't happen in reality, right? Commander~You Why is it coming in a cold sweat?"
 Punjabi_TouchDialog_1:0 "This dress is still a bit uncomfortable to wear. Although it looks very handsome, but...is it a bit too little?"
 Punjabi_TouchDialog_2:0 "Although our Sixth Destroyer Fleet is not so elegant compared with the rest of the local fleet, but wars are not won by grace..."
 Punjabi_TouchDialog_3:0 "Although I can't be as decisive as the firefly, I have to try my best to protect everyone."
  Punjabi_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's foggy on the sea? Commander, I suggest that everyone don't leave the port tonight to avoid accidents."
 Punjabi_TouchDialog_5:0 "The tribal-level sisters are scattered all over the world. Although the locations and methods of fighting are different, everyone is an excellent warrior!"
 Punjabi_TouchDialog_6:0 "Miss Hood did this today... The Prince of Wales is... Ah! Commander, why are you here! It's okay, hehe, just keep a diary, don't care!"
 Punjabi_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Your Excellency Commander... Hey, you don't seem to like this title, but Miss Hood and I learned it... It seems that Royal Navy etiquette is not necessarily that important..."

 Braine_TouchDialog_1:0 "I missed that important ceremony because of repairs, and now I regret it in retrospect. Fortunately, Miss Missouri is in the port area. You can hear many things from her that have not been recorded in the book. ."
 Braine_TouchDialog_2:0 "I just watched from the side, Miss Wichita's experiment failed... It was clear that the success rate was as high as 99% before. Could it be because I wanted to help on the way?"
 Braine_TouchDialog_3:0 "Xiao Tweet, it seems that only you will not be affected by my strange "ability". If everyone can be like you, I might be able to make more good friends..."

 Braine_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The lover is helping each other-bad, I almost said it. Are you okay? Huh... It's a good risk. It's not a way to go on like this. What should I do? Should I ask Miss Wichita? "
 Braine_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I got the "solution" for the first time...but isn't this a walkie-talkie? It's too abnormal to think about it if you are in front of you, but you want to talk like this..."

 Nagato_TouchDialog_1:0 "At your current level, you don't have the qualifications to become a Missy wing. How? Are you coming to receive the special training of "BIG SEVEN"? I look forward to your reply, but don't let me down."
 Nagato_TouchDialog_2:0 "In our hands, what kind of future can be opened up? For the sake of this world, there will be no more disputes, and for the children to be able to spend every day happily...I can't relax for a moment."
 Nagato_TouchDialog_3:0 "Admiral, without your support, we might not be able to get here today. The shared joys and sorrows over the years have made us extremely firm in our belief. No matter how steep the "mountain" is, we cannot stop us."
 Nagato_TouchDialog_4:0 "Mutsu, I know you are there, don't hide. Mutsu...? Oh, I forgot...she will be back in a while...this day is more difficult than imagined what……"
 Nagato_TouchDialog_5:0 "Admiral, is there anything I can help? Please, let me get busy. Otherwise, my mind is all about her... Saying nothing will not be lonely, it is all deceptive..."
 Nagato_TouchDialog_6:0 "Thank you, Missouri. I am embarrassed to call you out so late. But it's been a long time since I've had such an exciting battle, do you think so?"
 Nagato_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Since the replacement of the new ship equipment, the challenge books have been written one after another. Although it is a great help to the growth of strength, but it is not always going to be like this... If Mutsu is there, there will be no such troubles. NS……"

 Vanguard_TouchDialog_1:0 "I used to have an extremely longing goal and I hope to follow its pace. But now...I am who I am...right..."
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_2:0 "Commander, firepower does not mean everything. Speed, accuracy, and adaptability are all key factors in confrontation!"
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_3:0 "Commander, have you read the book "Control of the Air"? Today our biggest threat is above our heads. Only by knowing ourselves and the enemy can we win every battle."
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_4:0 "Although the gradual defense is pursued during the transformation, is it really okay for the sides to be so thin and light? At this time, the sea breeze is blowing, and it does feel a bit cool..."

 Vanguard_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The tragedies of the two predecessors of Hood and the Prince of Wales will not be repeated here. Only through impeccable defense and precise strikes is the king of victory."
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The change of times will inevitably cause many great changes. At this time, we must keep up with the trend...So, single ponytail or double ponytail, which one do you think will be more fashionable..."
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The countless previous exercises have allowed me to accumulate a lot of experience, and I will not have any fear on the battlefield... Sure enough, I have been wrong everyone before..."
 Vanguard_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "If I can mature a little earlier, maybe I can fight side by side with the predecessors and experience the years of heroic generation firsthand..."

 Tennessee_TouchDialog_1:0 "I was attacked in my own port area... This humiliation will not suffer a second time."
 Tennessee_TouchDialog_2:0 "California! Where did you go? Commander, did you see that girl? What a headache..."
 Tennessee_TouchDialog_3:0 "The main gun is justice! This power is not just for fun!"

 California_TouchDialog_2:0 "Why is Miss Missouri doing some recording work every day, shouldn't the flagship lead the team? What is it like to stay in the harbor every day?"
 California_TouchDialog_3:0 "Let’s go! Little guys, today our exercise is going to the enemy’s door... Haha, don’t be afraid, those cowards dare not come out."
 California_TouchDialog_4:0 "The guy in Maryland doesn't seem to feel pain from any kind of blow... Fortunately, he is a companion. It is terrifying to be an enemy."
 California_TouchDialog_5:0 "Everyone really likes duels, even in the evening... But this is the fourth report I have received tonight. Please go to the drill for the duel and don’t quarrel with others in the rest area."
 California_TouchDialog_6:0 "On duty is a bit boring, let's chat... For example, your past?"
 California_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "What do you want for breakfast?...How about a cup of very rich fresh milk?...Come on, don't be picky eaters, drink it in one gulp to keep you refreshed all morning."
 California_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Huh-morning jogs are really pleasant, will you be together tomorrow? It doesn't need to be too early, just accompany me in the second half of the run."

 California_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Is the night sky beautiful? Is it more beautiful than me?"
 California_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It's as strong as Tennessee, and it's hard to handle when it's inferior. As expected, Maryland's fighting method suits me!"
 California_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "You want to see it?...I will give it to you to satisfy your curiosity. These are the records of my duel with everyone. I used to lose more and win less, but now it is gradually reversed!"

 Colorado_TouchDialog_4:0 "The port area at night...reminds me of the place I used to stay, and it is so peaceful..."
 Colorado_TouchDialog_5:0 "Peace is not a day's work, you must be vigilant at all times."
  Colorado_TouchDialog_6:0 "Please don't worry about the inspection. I will not let anyone spoil the tranquility of this port area."
 Colorado_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey, is the weather a bit sweltering?...It's really unpleasant, if you can drink a bit coldly, it will be very...hey, have you already prepared it? Haha, it's more considerate than before..."
 Colorado_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Commander, get out of the way, today I won’t teach the girl in Maryland, she won’t stop... Rest assured, this is a contest between fighters, hehehelet me see if you have made any progress, Maryland. !"

 Maryland_TouchDialog_1:0 "The people who are enemies with me never understand that my kindness gives them a chance to survive, but I will change my mind at any time\n"
 Maryland_TouchDialog_2:0 "Hey, I should call the sisters for another fight. Ordinary training is too boring."
 Maryland_TouchDialog_3:0 "I heard that the big sevens in Country E and Country J are also very strong, I really look forward to fighting against it!"
 Maryland_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, I'm just bored to go out of Hong Kong to see the night scene... Hey, I really don't want to go out and fight..."
 Maryland_TouchDialog_5:0 "I didn't expect the impact of the power problem to be so great, but if you want to be faster... after all, I can't bear this powerful equipment."
 Maryland_TouchDialog_6:0 "I went to see the training of the aircraft carrier ladies that day, and I deeply felt that one day, they would be the protagonists on the battlefield, and we will eventually become supporting actors... the era of the big guns , It seems to be history..."

 Maryland_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Huh... a hearty battle, if you can have a glass... Haha, Commander, you really understand me, a glass of whiskey after the battle is really great!"
 Maryland_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "I used to think that fighting is meaning in itself, but now it seems that fighting with you is even more enjoyable."
 Maryland_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Hey... Commander, the injury on my body doesn't matter... OK, I'll just listen to you this time. I won't run around while recuperating and stay by your side, okay? Hey~ you just Don't be sullen, in fact, you've long been happy in your heart, right?"

 Maryland_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "She obviously should be an undesirable violent and bad girl, but now she actually started to learn these things...Ah! Ten minutes is here! It's time to put the seasoning...um...add more chili! Hee hee~"
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_1:0 "Oh-it seems that you can't rely on the seniors alone... I have to work hard. The humiliation that the seniors suffered, I will surely let the enemy repay it twice!"
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_2:0 "It will take some time for the new ship to adapt. Not only is the speed much faster, but also many new features have been added, such as...hey? How do we do this..."
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_3:0 "Ha! You are really not suitable for playing hide-and-seek, I discovered it again~~All main guns, prepare, volley! Hey, win the next round~!"
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_4:0 "The era of the cannon giant will never pass, as long as I am still there, as long as the big seven are still there!"
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_5:0 "The quieter the night, the more dangerous it is, and even the killing intent may be hidden at the moment of dawn..."
  WestVirginia_TouchDialog_6:0 "I am willing to wait until the sky is old, until everyone may forget all this... As long as I seize the opportunity, I will drive all those arrogant enemies into hell and never let anyone go!"
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "To call the seniors this morning, I yelled "the enemy is coming for an air attack" at the door of their dormitory, and I was beaten up by them...it hurts..."
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Cut-where are so many troublesome creeds of warriors, as long as you persist in surviving is a good ending. Is there anything more important than surviving?"
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Wow--! Sister Maryland, do you want to be so strict? I can't compare to you on my own, so please forgive me!"
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Commander, how do you say those submarines stay in the sea for so long? I can't do it. I feel numb when I think of diving... Well, it's terrible..."
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hey, if one day I was accidentally killed, would you help me get revenge? Even if I chase it to the end of the world... Haha, don't be so serious, kidding... But I still want to know your answer. "
 WestVirginia_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Commander, can you sit with me? Ah-nothing, I just want someone to accompany me, it's just... just happened to meet you..."
 Washington_TouchDialog_1:0 "Even if you are from the countryside, you should understand the importance of observing the rules. To achieve this, I don’t mind using some extraordinary means... South Dakota, do you understand? Or you want to taste my axe the taste of?"
 Washington_TouchDialog_2:0 "Everyone is very energetic today, very good. Commander, you see, there are many potential children among the newcomers this time, and they can become the backbone of the newcomers with reasonable training!"
 Washington_TouchDialog_3:0 "That guy from Veneto...does he really know what artillery is? This is obviously a mess..."
 Washington_TouchDialog_4:0 "No matter how many times you come back, the ending will be the same. Kirishima, don't do that useless work, the direction is wrong, no effort is useless...Of course, if you have time, I can give you some pointers..."
 Washington_TouchDialog_5:0 "Why did this guy fall asleep while on duty again? In case... no good! An enemy strikes... It seems that you owe me another favor, South Dakota."
 Washington_TouchDialog_6:0 "I wanted to convey the thought of freedom to the deep sea, hoping to resonate, but I didn't expect that the other party had a large number of creatures who could not think independently, and there was no way to communicate.

 Washington_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I just don't want to wake up that guy. After all, she will blame me when she is woken up. This is too troublesome, so why not... hey hey, tap..."
 Washington_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Oh-I am too busy at work and missed dinner again... Forget it, it's already at this point, just... eh? This scent is... Commander, come in, I just finished busy, you're waiting Long time?"

 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_2:0 "Lost in the future? Would you like a cup of coffee to soothe your emotions. Of course, please pour yourself."
  VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_3:0 "Don't want to provoke me with that kind of trick. If you really want to decide the outcome with me, just go to a duel in ancient Rome, how about it? Miss Nelson."
 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_4:0 "Andrea, why are you so panicked? How decent... cats? You are afraid of cats. It's really...obviously such cute creatures. I don't want you to scare them."

 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "You seem to be a little tired, so rest early. I can handle the next military affairs by myself... Is it weird? Or do you treat me as a child again?"
 VittorioVeneto_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Unexpectedly, the food culture is so extensive and profound... It seems that I can't be satisfied with Italian food and coffee... Well, I also need to fully grasp the oriental cuisine!"

 Richelieu_TouchDialog_3:0 "Although there are not many opportunities to meet, I can see that the burden of prestige is too heavy. If you are the general, you may be able to make her feel at ease... Not a joke, I believe you can."
 Richelieu_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sometimes I am also thinking, if I stood in the position of Hood, would I make the same decision?... But all of this is over, now we need to abandon the previous suspicion and the common enemy."

 Richelieu_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I dreamed that you were in danger last night. I would actually abandon the army... Feelings. It would really take away people’s sanity. However, this situation will not happen, I will protect you, please rest assured."
 Richelieu_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Wh, why suddenly I was asked to use the intimate address, although there are only two people... well... then... honey?"
 Richelieu_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The cheese tonight is really good. Would you like a glass of brandy? After that, it is better to go around the port area. I haven't had a leisurely walk with you for a long time."

 Taihou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Woo... I'm a little hungry, Admiral, do you have anything to eat here?"

 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_1:0 "Things are getting more and more interesting. Miss aircraft carriers, we don't have to argue about whose theory is right or wrong. It's better to come to a drill to decide right or wrong."

 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_3:0 "Please be sure to send me on the battlefield, otherwise I will not be reconciled."

 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Challenge the stars? I would love to try if I have a chance, but this is not my goal now."
 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "How many clothes to accompany me to buy another day? Sometimes I want to change to my normal clothes. Always working clothes will make others say that I have no emotion behind them."
 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Z46's new equipment is very good, I look forward to her good performance. Of course, I don't like dealing with children. These words of praise are more appropriate to you."
 GrafZeppelin_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Poets always like to magnify the pain of losing their love, and this is just a trivial thing that everyone experiences. There is a price to pay for the implementation of love, isn't it? Baby."
 Yorktown_TouchDialog_1:0 "Come on, business, I will go with Bumblebee to see how much you have made during this period of time. Is it a single tree or a single tree that is difficult to support?"
  Yorktown_TouchDialog_2:0 "To deal with a weak enemy, use a powerful force to suppress her. To deal with an evenly matched enemy, use your best tactics to defeat her weakness. But if you face an enemy several times stronger than us... just kidding, Is there such an enemy?"

 Yorktown_TouchDialog_5:0 "The stronger the appearance of the person, the heart may be extremely fragile. The company has undertaken too much. If she does not do well, please be more tolerant."

 Yorktown_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Senior Lexington, I caught Miss Saratoga skipping class. I will leave it to you if I want to punish her."
 Yorktown_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The company...now she is not perfect. Although strong, she is too lonely. At this point, Bumblebee and I have not done enough. In the future, how strong she will be... I can't say for sure."
 Yorktown_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The key to weight loss is to increase exercise. What's not good about eating more for more energy? Big deal...Soon we will have a night run together?"
 Yorktown_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Don’t try to sneak off my blindfold while I’m sleeping, there’s no door!...I’m not showing it to you, I’m afraid to scare you, if you beg me, I’ll..."
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_1:0 "Exercise? I'm sorry I am not interested. There are so many practical opportunities, who would be willing to waste time in the exercise field."
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_2:0 "Make a plan for today's battle, Saratoga, stop, are you sick again? Or do you simply do not want to fight with me in a team?"
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_3:0 "Sister, can you stand a little back during the battle?... A little bit further back, and... Bumblebee you too!"
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_4:0 "There is no need to criticize Saratoga. She and I have very similar destinies. She made her choice. I also have my own judgment. There is nothing right or wrong."
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sister, the work is very hard. Then...this, this and that, leave it to me. Don't worry, Miss Enterprise is invincible. I can do this little thing soon. Go ahead Go to sleep."
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_6:0 "If this radar had been researched a year earlier... Well, I can't criticize others. At that time, I was wasting time to provoke others..."
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Well, today's war is not over yet, right? Then you can't slack off, are you ready? Welcome to a new day of work."
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Commander, look, this is the shell I saw on the beach. Is it good-looking? How can I lack souvenirs when traveling? Next time, accompany me to find a good-looking shell?"
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "No way, no way, has this matter been arranged for the eldest sister?...Why, let Bumblebee help her, I can do the work of Bumblebee. Don't talk about the useless things, just follow My arrangement will do just fine."
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "A forest of trees, lonely heroes, sounds cool? But the stories of these heroes are ultimately lonely. I hate this feeling."
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "My head is a little dizzy, ah! Big sister, Bumblebee, why are you here, in... let go, let me go! I'm not tired, I don't need to rest, I... well, then I will sleep for a while, just After a while, remember to call me..."
 Enterprise_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Am I a little bit reluctant to myself? If you are aware of all this, it is really not a small thing. Well, I promise you that I will take a good rest when I can't hold it."
 Bogue_TouchDialog_1:0 "Oh, it turned out to be like this when attacking... Write it down-thanks, Senior Lexington!"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_2:0 "Ah, Commander. Did you see my notebook? Yes, yes! That's it! Thank you~"
  Bogue_TouchDialog_3:0 "Miss Langley also taught me a lot of knowledge, she is a very reliable person~"

 Bogue_TouchDialog_5:0 "Report! Commander, the inspection of the port area is complete! Are there any new instructions?"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_6:0 "Hmm, the maintenance of the carrier aircraft... It turned out to be like this. Ah, Commander~ Thank you for your coffee~"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 ""The Goddess of Luck is looking after you and me~" I don't know why I want to say this sentence. Ahhh~ life is like this, there are always various random events happening~"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Aren’t you curious about what I wrote in my notebook? Hey, it’s boring~ I have prepared a little story to fool you, but I still didn’t get the bait. Commander, I don’t understand subtly. People's hearts~"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Chaser~ I came back with a drink~ Ask my sister if I don’t understand! My sister is very reliable! Hmm, I’m listening"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The U-boats are really active, they are still running around this time. Ah, I can't control the carrier-based aircraft again! Quick, run, little guys! Hey, lie to you~ fooled Come on~"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The ring looks more beautiful in the moonlight~It's a wonderful thing~Just like you, thank the gods for guiding me to your side and being able to feel your love~ How about? "Romantic" words~ I learned it too!"
 Bogue_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Although it is not a battleship, as long as it can go to sea, it will be rusty when staying in the port area, ah, it is not rust in the physical sense! Don’t stare! There really is no birth Rust!"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_1:0 "Even the small daily things must be done with heart, so that one day they can catch up with the predecessors!"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_2:0 "It's so strong! If it's me... Can you do as well as the predecessors? Well... Come on!"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_3:0 "It worked! I can do it too! Humph, Commander, are you fascinated by my outstanding performance?"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_4:0 "The sky is so dark...nothing strange will come out? Yes, if the reconnaissance plane can take off...!"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_5:0 "It's great to be able to stay in a brightly lit office-well, in order to reward the commander, I have to work hard to deal with these papers."
 Chaser_TouchDialog_6:0 "I borrowed my notebook from Sister Borg, and I will be fine tonight...! Ah! The commander is forbidden to enter! Now it's lady's time!"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The commander is still the same, a small one. But I am different, I am already a mature lady, hum~ Do you need my sister to comfort you? Just beg me ~"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I can understand that there must be some secrets hidden behind the strong side of the commander. It doesn't matter, you can tell me anything. This vow has already linked you and me~ Your worries and sorrows , Let me bear it together."
 Chaser_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Sister, let me take a look at the notes. Ah...Is that so? I haven't noticed it. Sure enough, it's better to review it again after the course is oversister, what do you want to drink? Double serving, please buy it Come back~Thank you~"
 Chaser_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "No matter how sinister the future is, no matter what the end of this road will be, I will not abandon this vow. From that moment on, I have become one with you, regardless of each other. You, that is It’s all to me."
 Chaser_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "So, don’t give up hope easily. Instead of just waiting to die, why not take the initiative to fight for your future to the last moment. What's more, you have me by your side and everyone in the port area. This journey, It will never end in "loneliness"."
 Chaser_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The atmosphere is too depressing? How could it be that you have never had any sense of crisis like this! Really, at least look worried... You are really too comfortable, ah ah "
 Arromanches_TouchDialog_1:0 "Will I be with General Richelieu in this battle? Don't worry, I will do a good job in the support and live up to your expectations."
 Arromanches_TouchDialog_2:0 "According to the latest information, the enemy's defensive force in this place is very weak and suitable for surprise attacks. However, I think this information is very strange. Let me check again and consider whether to send troops."
 Arromanches_TouchDialog_3:0 "Split will only lead to destruction. Only by uniting can we defeat the common enemy."
 Arromanches_TouchDialog_4:0 "I used to think that I was not important, as long as I was not very conspicuous. But the encouragement of General Richelieu completely changed me. Now think about it, my performance in that mission was actually not Not great, but she acknowledged my worth..."
 Arromanches_TouchDialog_5:0 "Walkland, do you want me to train with me? How about tomorrow? As a light aircraft carrier, it is too difficult for me to let me take off at night..."
 Arromanches_TouchDialog_6:0 "Although there used to be a hundred years of grievances and fights because of position, but now that I am here, the tragedy will not repeat itself."
 Arromanches_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ah, the general called me? What's the matter... eh? Am I... too serious? Sorry, it's really... ah-no, don't hug me suddenly, I, I will try to relax ..."
  Arromanches_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hey, get ready, pack your luggage, and accompany me on the mission, um...not long, only 20 or 30 days, bring a change of clothes, I have already asked you a good leave for Instructor Ella , But there is no salary..."
 Arromanches_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "De Grasse is really an excellent person, beautiful, capable, brave... But who can think of how much pressure she has been under? Out of the mud but not stained is really a suitable adjective for her NS."
 Arromanches_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I go out to sail a lot, I like to record some customs and customs of the countries passing by, and make a diary. I will publish it when I retired. Maybe I can sell it for money~"
 Arromanches_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "General Li, Richelieu! I'm patrolling seriously, please don't worry! Huh? Is this, this snack for me?...Thank you, General! I...Ah, you are here, you see, General Richelieu gave me food!"
 Arromanches_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I was too childish just now, because I was so happy, I wanted to show off...hehe, but General Richelieu was also shy..."
 Princeton_TouchDialog_1:0 "A card represents light, and a card symbolizes darkness. When it merges, it is when chaos descends. At this time, I can summon my trump card... Heh, the outcome is divided."
 Princeton_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sa, Miss Saratoga, are you going to train together today?...Ah, by the way, I just learned a new little trick. Would you like to perform it for you on the road?"
 Princeton_TouchDialog_3:0 "Be hidden, and then summon your partners to attack, um-it's a perfect tactic! Try it next time you fight."
 Princeton_TouchDialog_4:0 "The dark night is the curtain of magic, under which countless miracles will bloom, and finally the beautiful sunrise in the morning is born."
 Princeton_TouchDialog_5:0 "The magician makes people happy and gives people hope by causing miracles in desperation, but he can only wander in desperation. Only with such an awareness in his heart can he be a qualified magician."
 Princeton_TouchDialog_6:0 "Just solve these files, right?... Hey, let you see how good I am... Hey! Drink! Phew-look, so many files, I have solved them! Not a single piece of paper was left, allall disappeared!"
 Princeton_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Ahh-accidentally got up late, hey, commander, why did you get up so early? Are you...are you going to do magic again? But the smell of food is already floating under the hat on the table, revealing ~Stuffing~Oh~Little fool~"
 Princeton_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I'm going to train with Senior Saratoga later today, and then...hey? Seeing you look unhappy, is it... jealous? Hehe, as cute as a child ."
 Princeton_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Commander, guess what, what's in this hat?... Hee hee, do you want to get in and touch it... Uh-did you touch it? Did you feel its temperature? Take it out... ah- Don’t use force, be light, don’t scare it...Come on, let the white dove that symbolizes peace fly."
 Princeton_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Is the bunny-like outfit very eye-catching? Hee heeactually, this dress is also an important part of the magic show~! For example...Look, this is the dress I designed for you. I like it. ?"
 Princeton_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The hands of a magician can create miracles, as long as you are willing to believe it, you can do it."
 Princeton_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "This is how the needle should be threaded here...well, this knot is wrong...Ah-it hurts your hand, it hurts... Let's take a break and continue, it's almost finished with this coat! The commander will be surprised. of!"
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_1:0 "Accumulated enough experience and obtained enough martial arts. This does not mean that you can stop here. The life of a person is a life of struggleall of these decadent views, you just have to listen to it. Okay, don't take it to heart."
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_2:0 "Even if I grow up, my opinion remains the same. François is the best beer in my opinion. Of course, alcoholism is not good. This is the eternal truth."
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_3:0 ""With fewer enemies, more enemies" is a very reckless thing in the eyes of many people. But as long as you have absolute strength, it is as easy as turning on the light in the room. What direction will a thing go into? , Varies from person to person."
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_4:0 "It's ridiculous to brand a person's life solely on the basis of fallacy. Disappointment, even this wine has become awful... You have to take responsibility."
  AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_5:0 "Don't be afraid, I am by your side. It is my unchanging vow to protect you and this port area. Go to sleep peacefully and enjoy the peace. When you wake up again, it will be a new day Good night, have a good dream"
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_6:0 "At this point in time, are you feeling hungry? The group of children brought back good things during the expedition. If you are interested, you might as well use a little. I can guarantee that Thuringian red sausage is matched with country G Special bread is definitely a treat."
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "No matter how much alcohol you drink, it is not something worth boasting about. A clear mind is what a soldier should have... hiccup..."
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "This world, no matter what changes, I will accompany you. This is an oath, I will not leave you."
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Although you have to do whatever you like, but some habits can't be changed. For example, beer? Haha, it's impossible to change, just like breathing, it has been embedded in life."
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Would it be better to be less spoken? Even if it is a simple word, you can know what I want to say? Well, I like it, you."
 AdmiralGrafSpee_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "This guy in Leipzig, the desire for treasure seems to be endless... I always feel that her eyes are a bit wrong when she looks at me recently. Wouldn't she be staring at my wine cellar?"

 Furutaka_TouchDialog_1:0 "Does this new outfit make me more handsome? Hehe, I didn't just change my clothes. Just wait and see."
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_2:0 "Equipment is only an aid, and it is the user who can determine the battle. Even the plain sugarcane, I can use it to exert the power of the sword and famous sword."
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_3:0 "Yikasa, you little fool, Aoba is over there. You can admit your mistakes with my ponytail. You are worthy of Aoba's sister. No, this is not to praise you. Don't be happy."
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_4:0 ""Aquarium"? It sounds very interesting. Wait, you have something to say, right?"
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_5:0 "After the doctor's processing, this knife has become lighter and sharper. It is said that there are new features? But the bad habit of the doctor never providing instructions, when can I change it? ..."
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_6:0 "This guy Jiagu... I don't know who I learned from, he is full of ghost ideas. You have to be careful, especially when she smiles at you."
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "This book says, "'Mischief' is an auxiliary means used by people to get the attention of others"...Couldn't this book be written by Kagu?"
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "If I have time, I really want to compare it with Denon and others. What is it to compare? Of course it is sword skill. If it is better than firepower, wouldn't it be bullying them."
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "If I can equip a larger caliber gun, I should be able to sit firmly in the first echelon, right? What, I can't think about it? You are really mean."
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Do you like Sudoku? This is one of my few hobbies. Come on, let's play together! I will not show mercy!"
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I usually use wooden stakes to practice swordsmanship. After Oyodo knew about it, I didn’t know why, so I had more firewood in my work...Could it be that she thought I was bullied..."
 Furutaka_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "The moonlight is so beautiful... You will always be with me, right?"
 Kako_TouchDialog_1:0 "Admiral~Wow, why did you step back so far? What are you worried about, I can't do anything~ If you don't come, I will pass by~"
 Kako_TouchDialog_2:0 "Although close combat is rude, it is not a means. Drive the enemy to a desperate situation, and then shoot with a machine gun-cough cough, it seems that something strange has been said, you just think what happened just now is a daydream Right~"
 Kako_TouchDialog_3:0 "Oh, "Aquarium"? Can you tell me who "praised" me like this? Oh, nothing~ How could I be angry  ah, this table is really not strong. Replace it with a new one. Right~"
 Kako_TouchDialog_4:0 "My sister went to the bamboo forest to practice swordsmanship. She is really a master. But the silver-haired double ponytail who lives there has a bad temper. When will she endure her sister~"
 Kako_TouchDialog_5:0 "Admiral~ I made some food, can you taste it for me? Oh, why are you afraid? These are just very ordinary dishes without any weird things added. Even if they are unpalatable, they can’t be compared. The one with purple hair and high ponytail~"
 Kako_TouchDialog_6:0 "I have collected a lot of poetry collections, as the so-called "the book has its own golden house"-these are priceless treasures~"

 Tashkent_TouchDialog_1:0 "Taking pictures used to be just my hobby, but because of this, I found a lot of beauty that I didn't find in life. So I became more cheerful, because there are so many interesting things waiting for me to discover, but I don’t have time to frown. of."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_2:0 "Isn't this Miss Fantasy?... I'm looking for speed to compete with you. I told you earlier that evaluating a person's strength is not only about speed... How about this, how about we change the game? For example... How about ensuring the clarity of the photo?"
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_3:0 "As long as the battle is not over, someone will look sad, so don't slack off, comrade, I will record every moment of your hard work. Nothing you do will be forgotten. "
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_4:0 "The night patrol starts, let me find if any bold enemies come here to make trouble~"
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_5:0 "There are various people in my collection of photos. Although they are different from each other, one thing remains the same. What I have recorded are their happiest moments. Therefore, I have a reason to fight."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_6:0 "If you pretend to be too long, you may deceive yourself. For example...Do you remember that Tashkent who was reticent?...Hee hee, okay, it's not difficult for you, smile, and rest in peace ."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "My dear, a new day has begun, come, smile, let me remember the smile you smile when you wake up every day."
  Tashkent_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Sisters’ smiles are so beautiful...For everyone and you, I must not let down my guard!"
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "It would be too lonely to cross this sea alone. With you by my side, I will have confidence."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "If you care about too many things, it will bother you. It's better to... leave me a smiling face when today is about to end, okay~"
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Let’s take a look at the photos together? There are the most precious memories between you and me. Look, this is what I took quietly when we first met..."
 Tashkent_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Look at your eyes... Do you want to say that my personality has changed after the transformation? No, never, I'm still the Tashkent, but I think... Compared to the coldness before, I can bring you a smile even more. …It’s been this way, and it’s very tiring…So, don’t make it difficult for me…"
 Albacore_TouchDialog_1:0 "Compared to the water fish, I am quite confident in my ability to avoid attacks!"
 Albacore_TouchDialog_2:0 "Today's training is how to deal with enemies with anti-submarine capabilities... In this case... Hey, Tianlong, you are here at the right time!... Hey, don't go!"
 Albacore_TouchDialog_3:0 "If it weren't for the slow speed, I would definitely be able to gain more combat exploits..."
 Albacore_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hey, why is there a red-haired man talking to himself there, it turns out that it is her... Watching me go quietly and scare her, hehe~"
 Albacore_TouchDialog_5:0 "The sea is dark at night. There must be a lot of interesting things to happen. If you have the opportunity, let's explore together!"
 Albacore_TouchDialog_6:0 "At night, how about letting me go to the enemy to play around, hehe~ Don't worry, I will protect myself."
 Albacore_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The commander is really sorry, I have been too busy recently, and I don’t know why there are so many tasks, and I don’t have time to accompany you. Why...Let me rest on your shoulder and call me later. ~whoop..."
 Albacore_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hah, you should lean in the commander’s arms during the day to bask in the sun... so comfortable, so warm..."
 Albacore_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hmph, you know how strong I am? I'm serious, but...Ah! When did you come, Commander, hehe, a drill is going on, a little serious..."
 Albacore_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Hey-since I accompany you every night, I rarely go to the sea at night, and I don't know if that guy is still so sentimental..."
 Albacore_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "(Whispering) Obviously and archerfish eat the same thing, why...ah, Commander, I'm not talking about anything! Hey, you got it wrong!"
 Albacore_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Commander, commander-hee hee, there is nothing wrong, I just want to call you, I feel... I feel at ease when I read your name... Oh, can I take a break? Tired? That's it..."
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_1:0 "I look forward to fighting with my sister. If we are there, the enemy will be invisible."
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_2:0 "The Pacific Ocean is really interesting, I won’t get tired for as long as I stay~"
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_3:0 "Although I can help everyone every time I set out, but... I still hope that I can defeat a big guy with my own strength."
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, I grilled three mackerel, let's eat together, I also called my sister... Hey, where's the sister? It was there just now, it's weird..."
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_5:0 "(Whisper) How can I move forward without any resistance? It always attracts everyone's attention, so annoying..."
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, let me tell you that my sister has sneaked out to play again. I will leave the port to help you catch her back, and leave it to me~"
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hehehehe~ The night patrol is over, and the commander is up? Next, I have to work hard. As for me, um, to supervise your work, just lie on your lap and sleep, don’t move around~ !"
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "If I have a chance, I would like to take a round-the-world trip. Will the commander accompany me?"
  Archerfish_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Commander...Is there any interesting task you can give me recently? For example, investigating deep-sea plants?"
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The commander is so busy every day and he wants to deepen his relationship with the sisters in Minato. It's no exaggeration to say that it is Playboy of the Pacific~ (laughs)"
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Is this green ribbon very beautiful?... Hehe, a friend gave it to me, and I also gave her a gift!"
 Archerfish_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Great mackerel... she has become very busy since she carried the name of the ace submarine, and sometimes she loses control of her emotions due to excessive stress. I really hope I can share some for her..."
 U47_TouchDialog_1:0 "Occasionally in the daytime when I get better, I will come out for activities~ Otherwise, the sir will accompany me to go swimming!"
 U47_TouchDialog_2:0 "The feeling of training at night is completely different from training during the day, training at night alone feels so lonely..."
 U47_TouchDialog_3:0 "Sir, sir, let's play hide and seek, okay~"
 U47_TouchDialog_4:0 "Ahhh! Is the sir frightened by my sudden appearance~"
 U47_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sir, did you see my wonderful performance underwater just now!"
 U47_TouchDialog_6:0 "Because I am undergoing concealed training, I will try my best to make the chief unable to find me~"
 U47_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "The Bull of Scarpa Bay is full of power! Moo! Moo! How is it, sir, is U47 very handsome!"
 U47_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "As long as the decision is made by you, sir, I can complete it, hehe~"
 U47_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Hiccuphey hey, the secretary and the commander are not there? I just drank some beer secretly after lunch, and it was miserable when I was found..."
 U47_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Hoo--sir, don't always bully me, I'm the leader of the wolves! That's--wow! Let me down! Ah!"
 U47_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I want to be with the sir tonight, and have concealment training...Why, sir, let's play hide-and-seek in the water!"
 U47_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Are you waiting for the end of my training every day... Sir, put your ears out~ I have something to say to you... You... you are... in my heart... for a long time!"
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_1:0 "There are more and more partners in the port area! Surfing will not be lonely in the future!"
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_2:0 "According to Dr. Yubari's prediction, as long as I go faster, I can carry out torpedo assassinations at the beginning of the battle with everyone!"
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_3:0 "Miss Veneto, we entered the port area together, and now I am finally catching up with you. Hey, so excited!"
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_4:0 "I remember that I lost my helmet when I first came to the port area. For this reason, I didn't dare to speak in front of everyone for a long time. I always felt that I was too stupid. "
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_5:0 "The dive begins!...Ahem, no, no, I will still choke. If the dive time cannot be shortened, I won't be able to help everyone..."
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_6:0 "Fortunately, this port has no disputes. It feels good to be able to unite and fight the enemy."
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Are these bento boxes for me?...Thank you, I can save a few days of canned food...Then these cans are for you, my treasured canned fruits!"
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I also want to be a person like General Richelieu. Although there is no way to lead everyone like her because of the ship type, the artillery diving can also have a big effect!"
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Quietly tell you that the afternoon tea of ​​the submarines is held underwater, if you want to eavesdrop, remember to bring diving equipment! It is the mouth of the sea!"
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "2 minutes and 20 seconds, can it be lower? ... After improving the ship's equipment, I should be stronger."
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Let me tell you that I was very cautious when I went to sea this time. I didn't collide with anyone or misuse it, although there was no gain..."
 Surcouf_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "This little fairy was given to me by Miss Guanghui. It's cute, isn't it? Sometimes when I am floating on the sea, he will fish in the stern of the ship, so behaved!"
 NorthCarolina_TouchDialog_1:0 "How? Are you scared by my transformation? After constant tempering, I can fully control this form. I believe I can help the commander more."
 NorthCarolina_TouchDialog_2:0 "Make a show? Sell cute? Now anyone dare to say that to me?... Stand up! If anyone refuses to accept, stand up, let's have a good fight!"
 NorthCarolina_TouchDialog_3:0 "Pretty, cute... are useless for fighters. These compliments will wait until I can't touch them."
  NorthCarolina_TouchDialog_4:0 "Maryland, while the commander is not here, I will take your challenge... Hmph, you are not the only fighting freak, and I will not lose to you!"
 NorthCarolina_TouchDialog_5:0 "Since my body has grown larger, it seems that I have become more confident, but my personality has become a lot more irritable..."
 NorthCarolina_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, I would like to ask you in private, everyone praised me as cute when I was small, but when my body grows larger... will it be cute?"
 NorthCarolina_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Tilbitz, I won't let you run again this time, Bismarck, don't stop me, I am looking for Tirbitz today...No one can stop me from fighting her to the death today!"
 NorthCarolina_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ahem...Miss Essex, for the seriousness of today's drill, I suggest you seal Bell's mouth. What do you think?"
 NorthCarolina_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Commander, this feather is for you...just as an amulet, it is very effective with my protection!"
 NorthCarolina_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Hoo...Is it only you? Then I will make my body smaller... Maintain a high-intensity energy consumption every day, the body is still very tired... Sometimes I want to restore this look, leaning against your arms."
 NorthCarolina_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I eat more... Is there anything wrong with eating more? If I consume so much, I naturally eat more... Anyway, I am not fatter..."
 NorthCarolina_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Hey, do you prefer the small me, or the big me now?"
 SouthDakota_TouchDialog_1:0 "Still emphasizing your own merits? Washington, now you and me, there is a qualitative gap."
 SouthDakota_TouchDialog_2:0 "Just blindly repetitive training will not increase combat power. It is more effective to produce corresponding equipment to strengthen itself through the analysis of the enemy's combat."
 SouthDakota_TouchDialog_3:0 "I analyzed everyone's combat habits and worked out the latest combat plan. Can you see if you can help?"
 SouthDakota_TouchDialog_4:0 "Is this a North Carolina training report? Show me... Yes, I expect her to catch up with me again, but unfortunately, not now."
 SouthDakota_TouchDialog_5:0 "Miss Enterprise, would you like to have some cakes together? I made them by myself."
 SouthDakota_TouchDialog_6:0 "Indiana, you made another low-level mistake during the battle today... Don't leave the unit to steal the limelight. This is an order."
 SouthDakota_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Take a rest today? Is it okay?...If it's your order, then I will sleep in peace of mind."
 SouthDakota_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Although Miss Missouri seems absent-minded in combat, in fact she has been looking for a breakthrough point. Looking forward to one day in the future, she can revolutionize the combat system."
 SouthDakota_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Can I manage this flower garden? I want to... plant some flowers from my hometown here."
 SouthDakota_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "In fact, I also hope that I can be as lazy as before, but if that happens...I don't want to see the disappointed expressions of everyone, nothing more."
 SouthDakota_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I am no longer afraid of the dark, nor will I be afraid of ghosts... Ah! What! Come out! Don’t be scary!"
 SouthDakota_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Why? The pastry just now, you want to eat too? Don't worry, I have a portion for you, how about it? The taste is okay?"
 Zuikaku_TouchDialog_1:0 "No one is born to be favored by "lucky", that kind of thing itself is fantasy. Relying on your own efforts to accomplish things that others seem to be unable to achieve, this is what you call "lucky" in the eyes of others "Is it easy to explain this way~ I have learned new knowledge again, thank me~"
 Zuikaku_TouchDialog_2:0 "With the weak anti-aircraft firepower of those soft-footed shrimps, they also want to cause damage to the blue frost that I am proud of. The trash fish that is not deep in the world also want to be close to the feather cranes flying above the blue sky? Really? Laughing and generous."
 Zuikaku_TouchDialog_3:0 "It doesn’t seem to be so easy for the seniors who want to truly surpass the First Sailing War... No one is stagnant... But it’s not a more challenging meaning! Keep running forward , One day they can catch up with the predecessors!"
 Zuikaku_TouchDialog_4:0 "Sister Xianghe... Why are you so nervous? I just went to get the snack from Liangyue. Don't worry, I will never let Sister Xianghe be alone again... We, we will always be together ."
 Zuikaku_TouchDialog_5:0 "You stand here with a smirk, making people feel unkind? You heard what you said just now?! So what!? You...Do you think I'm shy?! Look at me How to fix you!!! Qingshuang, attack!!!"
 Zuikaku_TouchDialog_6:0 "These battles are just small tests. I am eager for the day when we can truly be called a "fight". Ha, don't worry, as long as there are our Five Air Forces and the children who escorted us-- Nothing can beat us!"
 Zuikaku_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "This is a very handsome painting! You call it "green leather"!? Really, your aesthetic is really disagreeable! Ah! I don't listen! It's your aesthetic problem! Humph!"
 Zuikaku_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I can't say those sly words, even sisters do not mean the same way of speaking. You are prejudiced! Self-centered! I am me, there is no need to compare with others!"
 Zuikaku_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Oh...no, why should I sigh? There is nothing to regret, right? It's strange, is it the natural reaction of the body? Is there something wrong? I'll go to Yubari later."
 Zuikaku_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Ryotsuki's dim sum is really delicious. Even with my craftsmanship, I can't make a dim sum that can match her. Ah~ Although there is a sense of frustration, more of them are still happy. This one It’s great for the little girl to have her own hobbies, not to be a "shadow", but to live her own life. Well, very happy."
 Zuikaku_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Fishing with a carrier-based aircraft! Are you interested in this? Hey, just thinking about it makes me very excited, it must be very interesting! Okay, let’s come to the special training when the day breaks!"
  Zuikaku_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I don't know who held a carrier-based aircraft competition recently. As long as it is an aircraft carrier, you can participate. Seeing that Xianghe is very interested, I also want to participate. But...let her the opportunity. I’m satisfied as long as I stand by her and watch. Come and see when the time comes, and I’ll prepare my lunch~"
 Shoukaku_TouchDialog_1:0 "Um...Where did the spare propeller of the Gale wind go...Ah, here it is. Thank you. Are you going to participate in the carrier-based aircraft competition next? Very interesting look, it will not disappoint you ~"
 Shoukaku_TouchDialog_2:0 "Thank you for your hard work, senior of the First Air War. Thank you for your teaching. I have gained a lot. We in the Five Air Wars, we will definitely try to catch up with the footsteps of the First Air War. Each other's children are in the sky together The day of freedom to soar is very near."
 Shoukaku_TouchDialog_3:0 "The idea of ​​using thick steel to make a flight deck is really great. But for me, even if the deck is best protected, it still seems to be hit in other places and lose combat power... I don’t know. Why, I always think of this in my mind..."
 Shoukaku_TouchDialog_4:0 "It is possible to take off at night, but the level of danger involved is not just to say. No matter what the damage I have, I just don't want these children to suffer the same pain as me..."
 Shoukaku_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sister...Where did you go again-ah, did you go to make supper? That's it... That's okay, I thought you... No, it's nothing. Let's eat together~"
 Shoukaku_TouchDialog_6:0 "It is my "little lucky" to be able to meet everyone again and live in this port area. Only this, I will never allow others to destroy it. This is also me, what exists here, the meaning "
 Shoukaku_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "In the world, a grain of sand and a drop of water have its own meaning. It is these seemingly inconspicuous ones that draw the world into a beautiful picture. And you and me, only With this place to live."
 Shoukaku_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 ""Cowardice" is not a reason to escape. Of course, the pain of facing failure is not something that can be erased lightly. But if you blindly blind your eyes, how can you see the way forward? Haha, always That said, you will feel bored too. I will get rid of it, for sure."
 Shoukaku_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The peculiar young people’s drive to refuse to admit defeat looks really enviable. Haha, I always feel like an old woman, thinking about unnecessary things with unnecessary hearts. But now You, you don’t need me to worry about it anymore. Really, great."
 Shoukaku_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Every day I spend with you is a memory worth cherishing. Bit by bit, ripples in my heart. Being able to meet you and be with you is really the biggest in my life "lucky"."
 Shoukaku_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Sister, don’t run too far. To make you laugh, she sometimes messes around like a child. But I don’t hate it, it’s better to say that it makes me feel myself too Become younger. Haha, switched to the "Old Granny" mode again."
 Shoukaku_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I have completed the work as always. Thank you for your hard work. Keep it like this, and one day you will be able to improve. Finally, it is also routine-good night, dear. Tomorrow, please work harder."
 Hiryuu_TouchDialog_1:0 "Is it a new tactic? I understand. I will remember every detail and practice it. I promise that there will be no mistakes."
 Hiryuu_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sister Canglong, please be more serious during the exercise. Even if you don’t need to conduct the exercise anymore because of your strength, you still have to make a good impression on the younger generations who observe it. Please!"
 Hiryuu_TouchDialog_3:0 "Next plan-Admiral? Why are you here? Huh? Have been here for a long time? It's strange...I didn't notice it at all...Did you use the new stealth technology?"
 Hiryuu_TouchDialog_4:0 "Because it is the same island on the left, I must ask Senior Akagi for some questions. At this time, Sister Canglong will always follow me-as a genius, and will not miss any opportunity for improvement. "
 Hiryuu_TouchDialog_5:0 "Am I too focused on the training of heavy ship explosions? Don't you say that I haven't noticed...because Sister Canglong has always organized the attack waves of ship attack crews. Well, I have to try to help her. Share the pressure. Thank you for your reminder, Admiral."
 Hiryuu_TouchDialog_6:0 "The road to war is still very long. If you don't have a firm heart, you may fall at any time. Never give up-until the last moment, you still have to straighten up and move forward."
 Hiryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "It seems that the food intake has increased recently... Is it a negative effect of the transformation? It won't cause you trouble...? Please, please deduct the extra food from my salary!!!"
 Hiryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Sister Canglong, what did you just say? Have I become fatter? The tonnage increases...the speed decreases...it drags everyone down--no! I have to find a way..."
 Hiryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Shinano, are you on a long-distance race? Can you... let me join? There is no special reason, just want to exercise! Ahem... I'm gloomy. Go on, let's start!"
 Hiryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "The more you exercise, the more you want to eat. Dieting will affect your combat ability... What should I do? Just take the stomach--"
  Hiryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hmm!? Why am I... Sister Canglong? Why are we in the dorm... I remember I was in the kitchen just now...Don't mind? Okay, since Sister Canglong said so."
 Hiryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I look forward to the day when I can fight the First Air War and the 5th Air War. The scene must be very spectacular by then-what's wrong with you? You look a little ugly?"
 Souryuu_TouchDialog_1:0 "Whh.
 Souryuu_TouchDialog_2:0 "The most recent exercises were carried out with the First Air War and the 5th Air War. It's too cunning. In order to win, you have to use all your strength. There is no chance to be lazy... It's really troublesome."
 Souryuu_TouchDialog_3:0 "Don't make a joke to Feilong, that kid will take the joke seriously. As for me, please feel free to - I will return it in ten times the amount~"
 Souryuu_TouchDialog_4:0 "Obviously they are sisters, but the direction of development is different. I can understand that my sister is also like this. Isn't this also good? Is it interesting to have one more copy of yourself?"
 Souryuu_TouchDialog_5:0 "The kid said to help me share some pressure, and she has grown up. Hmm~ This is a good thing. While I am happy, would you like to make a few requests? Maybe I will agree."
 Souryuu_TouchDialog_6:0 "No matter how long this war will last, as long as it continues to win. Please use your ingenuity to lead us to victory-how about it? I sometimes say serious things~"
 Souryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Don't be stupid, the tonnage is heavier because your equipment has been upgraded. Why do you want to go on a long run with Shinano until you collapse... Silly boy, when will your problem with a tendon be corrected... Oh ..."
 Souryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Admiral, would you like to try this snack? Ah, look at your expression, please don’t get me wrong. It’s made for you. Yes, it’s made for you. Is it strange? I will take it if I don’t eat it. Give it to Tianhe."
 Souryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "...Don't you suddenly come over and eat my yokan, okay? Even if you are a child, I will teach you a lesson. I'm serious-okay, let's eat together. Hey, don't grab it..."
 Souryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Your wine gourd is finally empty, so happy. Ah...? Are you here to beg for tea? Are you serious...? Well, you are so strange. By the way, I like you very much. The hair color now is very cool."
 Souryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Oh, are you awake? It's a pity, I'm about to scribble on your face. Your crisis consciousness is really good. But I have to say a word, if you fell asleep in the quilt and caught a cold I won't take care of you."
 Souryuu_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "It's troublesome to deal with children, right? They only care about their own feelings and don't think about others at all...Ouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu, have another drink!"
 Shinano_TouchDialog_1:0 "Since joining Minato, it has been a long time. Until recently, I really understood what the path I was going to take. Times have changed, and we can't stand still. Tianhe ,let's work hard together!"
 Shinano_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sora has a powerful power, but I don't know how to use it-this is who I was before. Thanks to the enlightenment of the First Air War, I truly mastered my power. This power is to open up the future! Hmm! That’s how it feels!"
 Shinano_TouchDialog_3:0 "The hangar has also been repaired by Dr. Dr. Now I will never be called a "floating island on the sea" again! I really want to get a chance to show my skills quickly. However, considering If you have a budget, call me when it's a big event."
 Shinano_TouchDialog_4:0 "Senior, you came so early today. Wow! I know, I will start training right away, don't hit me on the head with wine gourd! Just shoot all these targets down today. . Tianhe, let's go!"
 Shinano_TouchDialog_5:0 "To be honest, the "future" is too far away for me. What I want to do now is to consolidate my strength and learn new knowledge. I also want to be a flagship and be everyone's support !"
 Shinano_TouchDialog_6:0 "My sister once told me that if you blindly rely on your own strength, you will only make yourself narrow. We are a whole, and only by trusting each other can we maximize each other's strength. I am moving in this direction Work hard! First of all, be friends with everyone!"
 Shinano_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Admiral! What should I do! The predecessors said that they want me to be the flagship of the new First Voyage War!? I, I can really take on such a heavy responsibility... I, actually... I want to try it !"
 Shinano_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Senior, I have a question! "Flagship"-what exactly should I do? I have asked my sister this question before. She just said that if the time is right, I will understand it naturally. "Timing" ...When is it..."
 Shinano_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Although I still feel a little nervous, I believe I can handle these things. Tianhe, our long-term efforts have finally been recognized! Next, it's time for us to express ourselves!"
 Shinano_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Senior Akagi, I want to increase the difficulty of training. This time, I want to challenge you and Senior Kaga! I want to explore more potential in the face of adversity. So please don't keep your hands! Let me See the first voyage in its heyday."
 Shinano_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It hurts, it hurts... Although I asked the seniors to use all their strength, but I didn't expect it to be so terrible! Admiral, it hurts so much, don't-ahhhh! It's okay... please continue..."
  Shinano_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Tianhe, we were almost "spattered"... It seems to be a very irrational decision to be one against two. Next time one-on-one, our chances of winning should be great! Good! We must let the seniors They were taken aback!"
 Wasp_TouchDialog_1:0 "Although the first attack can take the initiative in battle, the rear can also counter the enemy through timely counterattacks, so you can't be careless at any time."
 Wasp_TouchDialog_2:0 "Yeah, the battle report of Deep Sea has been published very frequently recently, let me see what else was said... Haha, I was sunk again? It's really inhuman, how many times..."
 Wasp_TouchDialog_3:0 "Compared to the Pacific Ocean, I prefer the Atlantic Ocean, where the waves are more violent, so that people can always maintain a sense of crisis."
 Wasp_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, can you accompany me for a few drinks after work? The ship ladies of country E gave me a few bottles of red wine. It would be too lonely to taste wine alone."
 Wasp_TouchDialog_5:0 "It is my mission to save others and protect the weak. Faced with people who are in trouble, no matter how dangerous the front is, I will not hesitate."
 Wasp_TouchDialog_6:0 "If the weak defense problem is not solved, I still feel a little uneasy. Although I can now counterattack the enemy as soon as I find the attack, if I get injured before the battle, there is no way..."
 Wasp_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Put your hair down...it will be messy, are you sure you want to see it?...No, you can't say it's not pretty!"
 Wasp_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "This military uniform is my proud work. Although the armor part is based on the Essex-class design, it has added unique elements!"
 Wasp_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Commander, would you like some honey water? Do you like it lighter or thicker? Would you like some lemon?"
 Wasp_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Maybe the enemy also has its own difficulties or something, but I will not be merciful because of this. All I can do is to do my best to eliminate every enemy."
 Wasp_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Wait until the holidays, do you want to go out and play, such as...an island in the Pacific?"
 Wasp_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Wasp is small, but it hurts to sting! I want to try it, Commander~"
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_1:0 "How about? Is this hat very handsome? Let me just say, there is nothing wrong with my aesthetics!"
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_2:0 "Even the seniors of Zhenghang, I am now confident that I can compete with them! Humph, I already have enough strength, I only need a chance to prove myself!"
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hmm... let me check, is there something wrong with the engine? This... the structure of this engine... I, I don't understand..."
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_4:0 "The night chime, what is itwhat time is it now? Admiral~Are you wearing a watch? Tell me the time"
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_5:0 "Okay, it's time for maintenance again~ Let's adjust the wing today. This place is removed, and then... and...ahhhhhose
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_6:0 "Admiral, I brought the new files here~ I will be busy tonight until early morning! Come on~ I will help you too!"
  Hiyou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Sure enough, the navigator still needs a hat to feel it! This is a serious matter! Please don't laugh! Ah, Falcon! Don't frown! Don't frown! Be happy!"
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Anyway, sailing on the sea is the greatest pleasure. Although there will be obstacles, just defeat those enemies! Now I am different!"
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Admiral, come here quickly. These children are given to you! Don't look down on them when you look at them. At a critical moment, this will not only protect you from harm, but it may also become a magic weapon to turn defeat into victory. How to Isn't it awesome!"
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Halal Eagle always can't let go of me, you have to know that I am my sister! Hmm~ But, I also like to listen to her nagging, so there is always a different sense of happiness~ ah, speaking of it It feels so strange..."
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Admiral, I almost forgot one thing! I haven't told you how to summon the children! First... read silently in your heart... Then draw your handprints... Finally you can summon them! Huh? Are you asleep? It didn’t take longwow! Is this time already?!"
 Hiyou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "When you put on the hat, you feel that you have become a lot more stable, ah! This is the power that the admiral gave me! To be honest, do you think this hat looks good? Ah! Falcon! You answered without asking you again. What is it! What is ugly!?"
 Junyou_TouchDialog_1:0 "Um... please don't stare at it. This is a windshield, a windshield, a hat-shaped windshield. Please think so in your heart, please."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_2:0 "Although it will lose to the seniors of Zhenghang in terms of the hangar, I am confident that I can make them "sweeping the floor with majesty" when it comes to culinary skills~ When that time comes, please come and join us, Admiral~"
 Junyou_TouchDialog_3:0 "Even if it is reduced a lot, "Tianhe" still looks so big...that is, only the deck of the armored aircraft carrier can support "Tianhe" take-off operations..."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_4:0 "At night, what time is the admiral's time? Huh? There will always be some errors if I say it. Here, the admiral's words are the truth ~ probably this feeling?"
 Junyou_TouchDialog_5:0 "Sister, you threw the parts directly on the ground again. It would be a big trouble if you don’t sort out the numbers. How many times will you have to say before you understand... Don’t show that expression, I’ll help, next time You have to rely on yourself."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_6:0 "Admiral, you’re always busy until late, so just spread the office with tatami mats? Then you can rest directly after work~ Ah, the budget is also a big problem, it’s really unfortunate~"
 Junyou_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Nice look, it looks a little bit. But momentum is not enough, hard power is also indispensable. Do you understand? Let’s start with running with a load, it’s all for your sake. Please don't complain."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "This is starting to gasp, your physical fitness is really not flattering. Forget it, just stop here, after all, you--oh? Have you rekindled your fighting spirit? That's not bad. That's it. It’s you, my favorite, the perseverance."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Flying eagle seems to have given you something, let me see-ah, she probably flattered it, right? But unfortunately, with your power, these children can't be summoned . Just treat it as an ordinary gift and cherish it. As compensation, I will protect you."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Wearing a hat is boring, do you have this kind of experience? But...it feels like a happy feeling, so forget it. Not all the things that fools like are useless. Ah~ what are you talking about? Ah, it makes me seem to be talking to myself..."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Look at your motionlessness, the sequelae of excessive overdraft physical strength is coming? I told you a long time ago that one step can't reach the sky. Alas, please lie down, I'll give you a massage. Don't cry , You shout, and I will increase my strength."
 Junyou_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Yes, some progress. I actually completed the work within the time I expected, so I must give you some rewards. Whatever you want, feel free to ask. I will not refuse."
 Mogami_TouchDialog_1:0 "The secret to becoming stronger? Naturally, it is to train hard every day and gain experience in actual combat~ What's the matter? Looking at your eyes, it seems I didn't expect me to say that. Hmph~ After all, I am too The top student in general subjects."
 Mogami_TouchDialog_2:0 "I wanted to keep a carrier-based aircraft as a pet for a long time~ In order to make this legal, I also specially tutored relevant knowledge. Then, I became an aviation cruiser~ Although it is an understatement, it is not Something that anyone can do."
 Mogami_TouchDialog_3:0 "The top students not only need to be excellent, but also have the ability to enlighten others. So, if you have any worries, just tell me. Big sister, I will be very considerate to guide you~"
 Mogami_TouchDialog_4:0 "The flight deck is heavier than expected, but with the added weight, it should not be easy to crash into others. Oops~ Sister, why are you looking at me suddenly? Sister didn’t do anything bad."
  Mogami_TouchDialog_5:0 "Admiral, don’t you feel tired? I have a way to refresh yourself quickly. Come on, get closer and callhow? Are you not sleepy anymore? Oh, why are your ears so red? Have a fever~"
 Mogami_TouchDialog_6:0 "When I graduated, everyone hugged each other and wept very sad, thinking that I wouldn’t be able to see each other in the futurewell, what a youth. I have never experienced such a thing, and my classmates are basically in Minato~"
 Mogami_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Let me think, is there a suitable place to relax a day. Rare anniversaries should be more or less romantic. Come over and make some ideas, don't let it go."
 Mogami_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "...Coffee shop? Although it is not the best, but since you proposed it, it is not impossible. Okay, you can change your clothes quickly, or say-I want me to change it for you~ "
 Mogami_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Why are you so familiar with the store manager here? And after chatting for a long time, I left me here... Admiral, are we really dating today? Bad..."
 Mogami_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Why, since you are not in that kind of relationship, why didn't you say it earlier? It made me sulky for a long time, just like a fool... No, you have to compensate me-I want to eat the ice cream over there, vanilla flavor of!"
 Mogami_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Oh, now I take a closer look, it’s not bad for you to wear this uniform~ If the admiral is also studying in the academy, it will probably attract a lot of attention. However, I will stand next to you in the end. ~"
 Mogami_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Well, it's so late, let's not go back at all~ I'm afraid of the dark, but don't want to - hey? You want to carry me? Well... this kind of happy and disappointed mood is really true Uncomfortable."
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_1:0 "Now I won't make any rash moves anymore. Although it is a pity to lose an excellent opportunity to fight, the losses caused by mistakes are irreversible."
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_2:0 "Atlanta, ah, don't, don't be nervous, I just inform you of tomorrow's training time. Don't worry, I'm not on the same team this time."
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_3:0 "Everyone makes mistakes, big or small, but the harm done to others is irreparable."
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_4:0 "Time is really a good thing. It can gradually take back the prestige that has been lost. She is the only one who is still afraid of me. Alas, the wound must be difficult to heal."
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_5:0 "The night sky is really beautiful, but it's too dark, I'm afraid I can't see clearly ahead."
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_6:0 "Commander, if you want to apologize to someone, what would you do?"
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Today's mission?...Huh? Atlanta, ah, I don't know if she is more afraid or I have more headaches..."
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "I remember that we planned to go out together today, there should be no unexpected events. The weather is good, pack up and go!"
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Dream talk? What dream talk...ahhhh, forget it, forget it all, I order you to forget it!"
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "It has never been so easy. I told Atlanta all my concerns and troubles. Commander, you are right. Only opening up is the way to solve the problem."
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "It's been a long time since I heard you compliment me... two more sentences... not sincere enough... well, this is a pass, but I still want to hear it."
 SanFrancisco_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "There seems to be someone there, wait, don't open fire, in case it is a friendly unit, it will be bad. Calm down, let's get closer and draw a conclusion. Anyway, we have the victory, right?"
 Baltimore_TouchDialog_1:0 "The best equipment, the best sister, and the best you. As long as we train hard, I can't think of the possibility of our failure."
 Baltimore_TouchDialog_2:0 "Macon, is the prayer over? Then let's go. You may not be used to the battle here. You need to practice more."
 Baltimore_TouchDialog_3:0 "Stop! Don't rush into it! Maryland, how many times have I said, act wisely, don't play recklessly on your own. Self-preservation in battle is the most important thing!"
 Baltimore_TouchDialog_4:0 "I hope our hero can return in triumph, not just keep his name for memorial."
 Baltimore_TouchDialog_5:0 "The rehearsal is for better fighting. Our battle should be foolproof, and any victory in exchange for casualties should not be praised."
 Baltimore_TouchDialog_6:0 "Concentrate the firepower and defeat them individually. This is the best tactic. What do you think? If there are disagreements, we can discuss it."
  Baltimore_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Good morning, Commander. Do you want chicken or beef for this morning's sandwich? What about the sauce?"
 Baltimore_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "It's like this here, and then...ahhh
 Baltimore_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "You are so good, you will surely be remembered by history, and I will follow your footsteps and keep moving forward."
 Baltimore_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Those words I said before...Ah-it's too shameful, don't say it anymore!"
 Baltimore_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I have imagined how my life will be many times, but I never thought that I can rely on your arms. It is really reassuring."
 Baltimore_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Gradually remember the names of the sisters! How about it, Commander, am I smarter?... Hee hee, I am already smart!"
 Katori_TouchDialog_1:0 "Count the number of people...eh? Why is there one missing person?! The destroyer over there, can you help me see who is missing?"
 Katori_TouchDialog_2:0 "Everyone must be prepared for battle, and the role each person assumes will change at any time due to changes in battle conditions!"
 Katori_TouchDialog_3:0 "Look at the little guys! The real threat to your lives is these guys buzzing in the air... Don't hesitate to encounter these things, just shoot them all down!"
 Katori_TouchDialog_4:0 "If you are not happy, just run and run with me, exercise can make people feel happy...Trust me, let's go!"
 Katori_TouchDialog_5:0 "Although it is hard to take everyone to train every day, it is also quite interesting."
 Katori_TouchDialog_6:0 "Ha! A bottle of carbonated drink is really enjoyable after exercise, eh? Admiral, would you like a bottle?"
 Katori_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Hey, admiral~ get up-don't sleep in bed, okay, otherwise... I will force you out~"
 Katori_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Come on, follow my beat, don't fall behind... Hey! Don't run around the destroyer over there! Really... Admiral, you can help too, don't just watch..."
 Katori_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Here... Give your knee pads, remember to wear them when you exercise, don’t forget~!"
 Katori_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Huhsweat all over, admiral you...Don’t lean over, I’m all sweaty now, I will feel uncomfortable if I touch it..."
 Katori_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Hey, look at you... I sweat so much after running two steps, come, I will wipe it for you~ Hee hee, hard work, hard work~!"
  Katori_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Admiral, I have developed a healthy recipe for you. Would you like to try it?"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_1:0 "Listening to those little guys complaining and complaining in the ear every day, I'm going to be annoyed to death. Ah~ It's a lot more interesting to go to sea. You can earn bounty and find treasures. You can kill two birds with one stone~"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_2:0 "It's really boring... Is there anything that can relieve fatigue... Hmm? Was it war exhaustion that just walked past? Her hat... Maybe there is a pearl hidden in it! Hey~ Let's go!"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_3:0 "Your Excellency~ Has anything interesting happened? Let me hear it~ In exchange, this bottle of beer will be given to you. I heard that it is Scheer’s treasure. Didn't you hear anything?"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_4:0 "Why does this old woman run so fast...Wow, Nuremberg! Why are you here too!? Ah, ah, yeah, yeah! I am also looking for a suspicious stalker! It's damn! I definitely want to catch her! Uh...Why do you look at me like this? My sister is telling the truth!"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_5:0 "I don’t know how to tell a story. If you have anything you want to know, it’s better to just ask myselfoh, it’s just right, Tirbitz~ come here. Okay, the master is here. Just ask what you want. Speak straight~"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_6:0 "Curiosity will kill the cat~ Oscar, if you keep following me, I can’t guarantee what I will do to you~ Ha! Lift it high~ Is it fun? Come again"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Take it seriously when you should be serious. No matter how you say I am an "old predecessor"~ But those little ones might be scared away by me...Haha, hahaha..."
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Sir, this is the financial report for this month...what's the matter? Look at me with that strange look? I haven't embezzled public funds. Before you doubt me, look at a mountain piled up in the warehouse. That tall blue box."
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Surfing on the sea? I don't want to try that kind of thing. Yesterday M planned to show us surfing excitedly, but was knocked over by the waves~ She was embarrassed at the time, hahaha~"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I don't use sonar for a long time, and it doesn't match my instincts. But, the new-style sonar of Z17 looks very fun. Would you like to borrow it for fun?"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "There is still gray here on the brim of the hat... Hmm, it is cleaned up. Next, put it on the mat, well~ Today's work is also successfully completed~"
 Leipzig_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Your vigilance is a little too overwhelming? I just came to cover you with a blanket. Why did you suddenly grab my hand. Oh~ Do you want me to sleep with you? Have such thoughts Say it boldly~"
 Arashi_TouchDialog_1:0 "Fourth Destroyer TeamListen to my command! Ah...I'm the only one here...Isn't it a polished commander now?! Somehow, it also made me prestigious!"
 Arashi_TouchDialog_2:0 "These explosive thunders are not only used to teach those voyeurs on the bottom of the sea, as long as they cooperate with my unique tactics, they can exert their power beyond the mines! Haha, just wait to see me show you! Kuroshio , Stand and don’t moveEeh!? Don’t go! It’s just a demonstration!"
 Arashi_TouchDialog_3:0 "After the modification, I am undoubtedly strong! No matter what the defects-all have been solved! Eh? Are you...? Oh! It's the admiral, I was almost confused, sorry~"
 Arashi_TouchDialog_4:0 "Hey! This sense of oppression... Could it be that... Ms. Jia, Kaga!? Me, I'm just doing routine night duties, not playing with searchlights? Oh, it hurts! Sorry! I'm so sorry! I won't dare anymore!!!"
 Arashi_TouchDialog_5:0 "Huh...what a bad luck, why did you run into a drunk Miss Kaga...huh? Is that a crab? Stop and don't run! My patience is limitless! Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
  Arashi_TouchDialog_6:0 "Ahhh, this is a trap set to fool me out of my post! Um……"
 Arashi_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 ""Type A Destroyer"-Does it sound very powerful? It's actually another name for the Yangyan type~ Sometimes changing the term will increase the freshness, right~"
 Arashi_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Ah! I forgot an important thing! I seem to have buried something in the beach and forgot to dig it out...what is it? The one that can turn...Ah! Nautilus!"
 Arashi_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "What's the matter? Are you staring at me all the time? Roar~ Am I so fascinated by you? Humph, after all, I am a fanatic~ But now, I belong to you alone~ "
 Arashi_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Huh? Is the one in front of Miss Akagi? What are you doing sneakily at so late? Do I want to follow it to see...Also, let's forget...It won't be good if I get beaten again... ..."
 Arashi_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 ""Old woman"...You are really persevering, did you bring snacks today? Ah, macarons! Hey, let’s make an exception today~Thank me~"
 Arashi_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Admiral, don't be angry... It's just a whim and scribble on the table! Then the pen you put on the table happens to be a marker... coincidence! It's all a coincidence! Ha, ha ha..."
 Z17_TouchDialog_1:0 "The equipment has been upgraded in all aspects. It seems that it will take a while to fully grasp this new power. Well, I won't let you down."
 Z17_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sisters have their own areas of expertise, and I am no exception...again, this is not an ear, please don't touch it again! I will be angry!?"
 Z17_TouchDialog_3:0 "Hans, don't shake your gun everywhere in the port area, it will cause panic. Disarm before the duty time, and be obedient~ I will add a red sausage to you at lunch~"
 Z17_TouchDialog_4:0 "I didn't expect the Cossacks to have such a wonderful singing voice, which is really surprising. Um... She glanced over here, wouldn't she find me?! Oops... You have to hide quickly"
 Z17_TouchDialog_5:0 "Hmm? The sonar state has switched to red... Is there an enemy around? No... Or, is the "old woman" nearby again? This is probably the most reasonable explanation... Alas.
 Z17_TouchDialog_6:0 "Where did this deep bomb come from... How can such a dangerous thing be littered casually? Let me see, there should be no detonation time... Huh, the recovery was successful. Today, I also successfully defended the peace in the port area. ,Um!"
 Z17_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Are you so interested in this headband? Let’s say it first, this is not an ear, it’s just made like this, it’s actually a sonar... Of course it’s so cute! I’m also a female My child!"
 Z17_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The original plan was to install a flight propulsion device, but the development of that component seems to have reached a bottleneck, so it was put on hold. It's a shame to think about it now, how will it feel to fly?"
 Z17_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Oh, where's the snack you just put here? Who took it? Hans, did you see...what was on your lips? Hans Ludmann, what did you just eat? ~How about telling sister?"
 Z17_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "There are many unknown dangers hidden in the sea. In order to effectively prevent emergencies, sonar is used. My hydrophone is not only cute in appearance, but also highly effective~"
  Z17_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Although it has the appearance of a gun, this is essentially a cannon. It is probably a disguise, right? Sir, what did you do before you became a soldier? The topic became too fast. Isn’t it a little bit? Scared? Haha, you will get used to it."
 Z17_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Sir, the bed has been made for you~ Ah, can I stay here for the night because of the gate time? I know you will agree~ hee hee~"
 Z18_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hide and seek, are you sure you want to play with me? My sonar is always on. I will find you wherever you hide~ I have been invincible from the beginning, this is my creed ~"
 Z18_TouchDialog_2:0 "Obviously it was training, but Z17 never kept his hands, just like in actual combat, which makes me feel uneasy if I don't have weapons in my hands. Wow! Z-sister Dieter! Hey... Why are you here~ I, I'm just walking..."
 Z18_TouchDialog_3:0 "Sister Hipper’s haircut with a hat would be the perfect "hard-hard"~ Hmph, a new case, "Firefly at the Lake", is now available~ Come on, explore the event The truth!"

 Z18_TouchDialog_5:0 "Due to too much noise, the shooting range has been temporarily suspended. The fun of the night is missing again... Sir, is there anything I can do instead of shooting? Hey? Playing video games? Miss Tirbitz played it. That kind, it sounds interesting..."

 Z18_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Captain Leipzig! The wind is good, just waiting for your order! Which sea area are we going to explore the unknown treasure?! Hey, Oscar, do you want to come too? Ok~ Let's go together!"
 Z18_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Good vision, it will take a while to reach the coordinate location at the current speed. Captain, your face is not very good. Is this symptom because of seasickness? How is it possible-hey hey?!"
 Z18_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "...I finally came back without danger, fortunately with the ship outfit, otherwise I don’t know how long it will take to swim back from there... This is the first time I feel how happy it is to be down-to-earth ..."
 Z18_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Flying propulsion device? I have seen a prototype. It is said that it was prepared for Z17? That is not too big to use. Besides, it will be easier to be attacked by carrier fighters if you fly to the sky, it's stupid~ "
 Z18_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Although Z17 has a bad temper, the snacks she makes are rare and delicious~ Hush-don't tell her that this jar of cookies is with me~ You can eat one too, so we are on the same boat. "Friends in trouble"~"
 Z18_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Miss Tirbitz~I'm here to pay back the game disk~ Is there any recommended game this time? I don't want the collection category. It takes too much time to get achievements~"
 Hoel_TouchDialog_1:0 "Samuel Roberts' training score is much higher than the data predicted based on her equipment, even after the transformation...too amazing..."
 Hoel_TouchDialog_2:0 "Commander, I have sorted the documents and placed them on your desk. The coffee is in the coffee pot, the tea is also brewed, the drinks are in the refrigerator, drink less and pay attention to health... Then, I'm going to train. , Wait for me to come back and continue to help you with your work."
 Hoel_TouchDialog_3:0 "I'm going next...Is there two hours left? Then go to the library. If you can't charge it in time to learn more knowledge, it won't help the commander."
 Hoel_TouchDialog_4:0 "Release of smoke is a very special way of combat, because it affects the enemy’s judgment and also interferes with one’s own combat vision... Use it with caution, but... Protecting friendly forces on the battlefield is far more important than killing the enemy. many."
 Hoel_TouchDialog_5:0 "Commander, would you like some dessert? I have frozen pudding and sago in the refrigerator. If you need something hot, wait a moment. I have prepared hot chocolate and small cakes for you."
  Hoel_TouchDialog_6:0 "Working, chatting, eating together every day...This kind of life is really intoxicating. I almost lose the motivation to move forward. It feels like a kid falling into a honeypot, hehe..."
 Hoel_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Johnston, how long will it take to go out on patrol this time?...Wh, what?! Two days! Wait a minute, I want to write a message...Ah, no, I forgot to take something, and It took two hours to leave, and I will be back on time."
 Hoel_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "The shelf life and eating methods of all foods have been posted on the refrigerator, and the best drinking habits for coffee and tea are also posted according to preference priority. What else, what else... Ah, by the way, files, files … Organize the files in order of priority, but there is still time..."
 Hoel_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Even if I occasionally go out to perform tasks, you can keep things organized. It's much better than before. It's worthy of praise... I will make it for you tonight... Commander, why is the refrigerator empty?... Alas, dessert and Although the drink is delicious, you should pay attention to your diet..."
 Hoel_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "You seem to have eaten a little bit for dinner today. Did you lose your appetite or lose weight? I made some iced snacks. If you are hungry, I will eat a bit... Put it in the refrigerator~"
 Hoel_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Do you like day or night? I am... um-I was defeated... I, I like you."
 Hoel_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Huh-it takes a long time to read the information, and my head is a little dizzy. It seems that I have to give myself... ah, thank you... when did you learn to make tea... um-let me taste it, it's warm and delicious, like You too."
 SamuelBRoberts_TouchDialog_1:0 "Train, continue training, I can be stronger... Ah, Commander, when you arrived, I didn't notice..."
 SamuelBRoberts_TouchDialog_2:0 "The speed of 28.7 knots is not the limit, and firing 325 shells in 35 minutes is not the limit...Where is the limit? I don't know. It is this unknown that makes me feel excited to move forward."
 SamuelBRoberts_TouchDialog_3:0 "Johnston, since it's a heads-up, don't be too troublesome, I will just rush forward, are you ready?"
 SamuelBRoberts_TouchDialog_4:0 "If you fail because you didn't tap your abilities to the limit, that would be the greatest shame."
 SamuelBRoberts_TouchDialog_5:0 "Ordinary brings misfortune, just as incompetence leads to self-destruction...Have I said anything about the desire for the ordinary?...Forget about it."
 SamuelBRoberts_TouchDialog_6:0 "It is really curious how far the future radar technology can develop. Once we used our eyes to observe the enemy, now we rely on radar... Will there be radars with wider coverage and higher accuracy in the future, so as to avoid weak spots. People were attacked..."
 SamuelBRoberts_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Johnston was still careless after going through that...but I'm afraid all this is just appearance, I will never forget the scene where she stopped the enemy with red eyes...deserted? A joke, dare you at that moment The one who stands in front of the enemy and blocks the way is the one with abnormal brains."

 SamuelBRoberts_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Taffis’ private gathering is actually a matter of a few dull guys complaining about their current situation. After all, everyone walked around in hell together and became sisters who were born and died."
 SamuelBRoberts_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I hope I can run away when encountering an enemy more than twice as powerful as myself, as a slogan that every ship’s lady must keep in mind... It’s enough to have a few people with abnormal brains, everyone can forget us The heroic battles of the People’s Republic of China are the most helpful to everyone."
 SamuelBRoberts_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Commander, it’s better to rest early in the evening...I, my words...I still want to work harder, today’s physical training is not over yet...or else, let’s work hard together and rest together... Just make an appointment All right."

 Johnston_TouchDialog_2:0 "Fighting is supposed to be a lighthearted and pleasant thing. The two sides agree to fight, compete for victory and defeat, and then happily make an appointment next time and place bets on each other. This is what a fight should be like, so I like it very much. Maryland also admires her very much."
 Johnston_TouchDialog_3:0 "If Juno is willing to lower her head and listen carefully to other people's advice, she won't get seriously injured frequently in battle. Fighting is a very serious matter, not trivial... Forget it, even if I say so, she will I was criticized by them for wanting to be a deserter again, so let you do this kind of trouble."
 Johnston_TouchDialog_4:0 "Commander, you said why people always like to praise battles that win more with less... Obviously, it is a very sad thing to fight with fewer people, and to fight with the weak. It is a very sad thing to avoid instead of praising. "
 Johnston_TouchDialog_5:0 "I am not afraid of trouble, but to deal with a troublesome thing, which will delay me from dealing with many simple and direct tasks, and I don't like inefficient things."
  Johnston_TouchDialog_6:0 "The person who uses the weapon will determine the soul of the weapon, and this will also be the key to determining the outcome of the battlefield."
 Johnston_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Today’s training I escaped...Hey, it’s fine if you said that you would let me be more free to be myself in the future. Why do I regret it now...Let it go, let go, I don’t like training...Ahhhh What the officials say is nothing!"

 Johnston_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Learned from and from Hoel, is this cream cake okay?...Although the cake itself is a bit baked, I tried it and it tasted ok, and it’s not impossible. Eat...haha..."
 Johnston_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "The Tafe Three Team became famous after that battle. Both me and Hillman were given higher expectations. Although this is what we have always expected, we have achieved expectations that exceed our own abilities... Instead It's a burden. Commander, what do you say I want to do?"
 Johnston_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "According to my observation, Juno should listen to Sullivan's words the most, how to tell Juno not to be willful on the battlefield and leave it to you... As for me, these things are too troublesome. I don't want to see them again. Add a lot of trouble."

 Barfleur_TouchDialog_2:0 "Ms. Hood's behavior is very in line with the British lady. I respect her very much. But she actually added tea to the afternoon tea. I would never agree with this."
 Barfleur_TouchDialog_3:0 "If the Prince of Wales likes tea instead of red wine, I think I would like her better."
 Barfleur_TouchDialog_4:0 "Call-there are more and more affairs in the port area, and maintaining elegance seems more and more like a challenge."
 Barfleur_TouchDialog_5:0 "I miss my time as a rowing girl very much. It is very interesting and exciting. If there is such an opportunity next time, I will not miss it."

 Volta_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Time is almost up...you will cheer for me in the duel tonight, right?"
 Volta_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Hoo... I’ll rest early when I’m busy... Today’s victory and defeat... Confidentiality. But there’s nothing worth saying, no one can win two games in a row now, so a single victory is meaningless."
 Impero_TouchDialog_1:0 "The life of an aircraft carrier is really easy and comfortable. There are so many people who are better than me. I don't need me to play. I only need to read a book to get my salary. It's so easy."
 Impero_TouchDialog_2:0 "We also set up a book club, where the members are all comrades who have encountered the same thing as me. You should be very clear about who they are. Oh, Tianying has sent a text message, I should go ~"
 Impero_TouchDialog_3:0 "Eldest sister, even if you look at me with that~ what~ scary eyes, nothing can change. Moreover, my test scores are very good, but it is not pure "plaything". You see, I still understand Foreign language~"
 Impero_TouchDialog_4:0 "Yes, even if I look really lazy, there are some things that I can't completely give up. For example, strength~ Don't let the name of the "Veneto" family be embarrassed because of your willfulness."
 Impero_TouchDialog_5:0 "If you have any recommended books or videos, please don’t be stingy and let me know them all. Anyway, if you are idle, you should just add new knowledge. Ah, there is no need for horror. I am very courageous. Little...really."
 Impero_TouchDialog_6:0 " expressionless, say me? That's not great. The book says that the "mouthless" attribute stimulates the desire for protection of others. However, it doesn't seem to work much for you?"

 Impero_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "This gesture is used for bluffing~ Don't you think this can just make up for my lack of expression. How about? It's pretty cute. Give me a few more praises~"

 Impero_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "I hate the bitter taste, even a little bit will make me allergic. But if I eat too much sweets, I will get a toothache and gain weight, ah~ life is so hard."
 Impero_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "As long as you work hard to complete these tasks, I will touch your head as a reward. Huh? The reverse is also possible. It is said to be a reward, as long as it is not too much, it should be fine."
 KangWon_TouchDialog_1:0 "Is my development a bit too sudden... Hee hee, I didn't expect it to be so fast, maybe, I will bend over when I talk to you in the future."

 KangWon_TouchDialog_3:0 "This dress still fits well, isn't it?... Chungmu is really good."
  KangWon_TouchDialog_4:0 "Tsk-beware of senior Ulsan for roast beef, otherwise she will smell it. At least we need half of our food..."
 KangWon_TouchDialog_5:0 "During the renovation, I stopped by to meditate in the mountains of my hometown... After the stress was released, it felt so good, maybe... this is why I suddenly developed?"
 KangWon_TouchDialog_6:0 "Nature has given us everything. These enemies always want to treat nature as their own possession. They are so arrogant... I want to teach them instead of nature."
 KangWon_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Come on, admiral, hang a bell on my clothes like me... so that I can hear your movements wherever you go."

 KangWon_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Are you scared? If you come back late next time, I will make the scene even more horrible!...I'm not kidding!"
 KangWon_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I will always guard this harbor. Of course, this is because there are sisters and you in this harbor."
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_1:0 "Hey--! How is it? Am I very handsome with this trick?"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_2:0 "Jiangwon, you are growing too fast. Alas, it's a pity that you can't keep touching your head. Then... let you touch my head instead!"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_3:0 "I like this dress very much, so even if it is remodeled, I will not change it."
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_4:0 "Gangwon is tall and beautiful now, and he won't be bullied. The commander should also like her very much, right?"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_5:0 "The current clothes in Jiangwon are also made by myself~! How is it? Great, right?"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_6:0 "You took good care of the potted plants in the office. As a reward, I will give you two more pots!"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Huh-it's really comfortable to work out in the morning, do you want to come together?"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Don't rush, you can't make clothes so fast. If you really want to put them on earlier... Well, I'm busy today. You can help me go out and buy some of these raw materials. Hey, come on!"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Huh-a little tired, Commander, can you cook today's lunch? I want hot pot!"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "My dream is actually to become a gardener, but if the world is destroyed, no one will appreciate the beauty of nature, so I came to the battlefield. When everything is over, I will continue to study gardening! "
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Come, stand here without moving, I want to measure the size... Hey, you're done, I will make you the most beautiful dress!"
 ChungMu_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "Gangwon! Yeah... I can’t reach my head, can I lower my head and let me touch my head."
 U1405_TouchDialog_1:0 "1206, senior, I am transformed, ahead of you, faster than you, are you envious? Are you jealous?"
 U1405_TouchDialog_2:0 "Sir, are you here to inspect your work? My work is underwater, so please follow up with me. If you lose me, I will report your inability to work to your superiors."
 U1405_TouchDialog_3:0 "I don't play with you children, the big game is my hunting target."
 U1405_TouchDialog_4:0 "Huh? That is...1206's ship outfit?! Her ship's outfit evolves so fast. Some time ago, she could only run on the sea by herself, and now she can drift on the road."
 U1405_TouchDialog_5:0 "Is there anything wrong with what I said? I just told the truth of many people's inner thoughts. And ah, everyone was talking humble, no one said weird things, how boring."
 U1405_TouchDialog_6:0 "If everyone could be as fast as me, the battle would be over long ago, wouldn't it?"
 U1405_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "Well, no matter how long it takes, you are the chief who likes to sleep in... Forget it, I think this is also good."
 U1405_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "It seems that you have adapted to diving training, then, I have a task for you-to catch the U1206 out of control ship equipment and bring it back. Only success, no failure!"
 U1405_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "If I judge that you are in danger, I will take the initiative to expose my position and lead away the enemy. You must take the opportunity to escape and not save me. Do you understand? That group of waste can't catch up with me, this lady You are not allowed to object to the genius plan!"
 U1405_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "Hey? So I used to call you an idiot, a fool, an idiot... Sorry, I didn't scold you deliberately before... Can you forgive me? Hey, dare you next time!"
 U1405_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "U1206, I found the ship for you! Next time you may not have such good luck to find it...why, when will you look like a predecessor!"
 U1405_TouchDialog_oathed_6:0 "I met my opponent tonight... That indomitable guy, why is he so arrogant!"
  Hayaharu_TouchDialog_1:0 "Onmyoji is a profession that can only be performed by men... Do you know how surprised I was when I heard this! However, my predecessor said that I could study in the mountains for a period of time. If it goes well, I might become Where's the witch!"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_2:0 "Recently, I have gradually been able to hear the voice of China Dubi Ancient God. It seems that my efforts have been recognized by China Dubi Ancient God. You are right! As long as you work hard, it will be fine. There will be rewards~"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_3:0 "I'm very proficient in using these equipment. After all, Senior Qiuyue and they have been serving me as a sparring partner. There is no reason for me to remain strong. However, Xiaoyue does not participate in training every time. What are you doing on the other side. It seems, still very happy?"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_4:0 "Senior Kitakami will always come and call me to play mahjong together these days, saying that I can bring her good luck. I am a little happy... But if it is a request to form a team, it would be even better. Doesn’t it feel weird if luck is used in these places?"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_5:0 "The doctor is really amazing. He has added a lot of new features to my torpedo. For example, it can also be used as a refrigerator to store drinks. Huh? What about launching...? Wow... I never thought about it. After this..."
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_6:0 "Do you feel comfortable with me next to you? Admiral, I didn’t expect you to say this. Hehe, as long as you like, I can stay here forever. Don’t bother me when that happens. ~"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "I want to make more friends"I once prayed to Lord God like this. My sister also said that nothing can be done by herself. Therefore, I will also go to the dormitories of other teams today. Be brave Knocking on the door! Then-convey your heart to them!"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Senior they taught me a lot of useful things-eh? Are you interested in useless knowledge? Well, they want me to be with you often, and then show a girlish side, saying that you Would like me more. But, I guess it’s not necessary anymore~"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "Today’s goal is to talk to Ayanami-senpai! Last time I knocked on the door, an evil spirit came out! It’s the kind with horns on the head. Oh my god, I was scared and ran away right away I hope I won’t run into it again today..."
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_oathed_4:0 "I can already summon a small shikigami~ Wait a minute, I will show it to you right away. Let me think about it. The most suitable shikigami for this scene is-oh! I found it! 1, 2, 3"
 Hayaharu_TouchDialog_oathed_5:0 "Admiral? Are you okay. Sorry, just now I don’t know why Shikigami attacked you suddenly...Huh? My lips are a little swollen? Well...I don’t know much about artificial respiration, so... Uh, uh..."

 StGeogre_TouchDialog_3:0 "You can't relax your combat readiness, but life can't be abandoned. Let's relax with a cup of tea with the sisters this afternoon."
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_4:0 "Evil creatures breed every day, so I can never stop."
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_5:0 "The children of God are angels, and Satan is one of them. Angels will become demons, and dragon slayers will...maybe, it's me who is worried."
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_6:0 "It's beautiful to smile? Thank you. I am used to the same compliments. Such simple words make me happy."
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_oathed_1:0 "My dear, are you awake?...What's the matter, now there are only two of us. Wouldn't it be too cold for me to call you the commander?"
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_oathed_2:0 "Hood, can you teach me how to make black tea? Put the tea or the milk first...Ah, don't make a noise, alas, why is it fighting..."
 StGeogre_TouchDialog_oathed_3:0 "The children are cute, right? They are like a blank sheet of paper, and we need to describe the future for them."
